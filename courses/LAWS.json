You must learn how to analyse legal problems, research the relevant law and apply the law to the problems. This course is intended to provide an introduction to these skills which will be honed by your further legal studies and application of the skills.This course is very much \u201chands on\u201d, as it will aid your learning by preparing answers to legal research problems. The problems may be from a variety of legal areas. By analysing these problems you will identify the legal issues that need to be researched. You will then be introduced to legal research resources, both paper and electronic, and guided through the research needed to provide a framework for your answers to the problems. The presentation of your answers is of the utmost importance. Lawyers must be effective communicators and have a command of language both written and oral. This course will introduce you to clear and effective presentation of your answers in writing and orally. For both writing and oral presentation you will learn how to structure, explain and support your legal analysis.Law differs from many other disciplines as you may be writing or presenting for many different audiences. Thus you may have to prepare answers to legal problems which are to be presented to your professors, a client, colleagues in a law firm, or in court. The skills required to prepare a summary of the relevant law for a busy partner in a firm are very different from those required for your legal essays as an undergraduate. You will also be taught how to make your presentation persuasive if appropriate. You will be encouraged to consider for whom you are researching and ensure that your writing and presentation is appropriate for your audience. You may be required to prepare the answers to these problems in written form, as short essays or legal memoranda, or orally, by way of short presentations before your peers or in a moot.The course will be taught by way of lectures and tutorials. In the lectures your professors will introduce legal problems to you and explain how they are analysed, how they are researched and how this research is then applied to the problem to prepare answers. In the tutorials you will provide the analysis, research and answers.", "outcome": "        By the end of this course, students will be able to:  Analyse legal problems; research the relevant law to deal with issues raised by their analysis; present answers to the legal problems they have researched.  \u00a0    ", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2025-26 Term 1": {"--LEC (4917)": {"startTimes": ["9:30"], "endTimes": ["11:15"], "days": [3], "locations": ["Institute of Chin Studies L1"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["3/9", "10/9", "17/9", "24/9", "8/10", "15/10", "22/10", "5/11", "12/11", "19/11", "26/11"]}, "-T01-TUT (4918)": {"startTimes": ["11:30"], "endTimes": ["12:15"], "days": [3], "locations": ["Institute of Chin Studies L1"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["3/9", "10/9", "17/9", "24/9", "8/10", "15/10", "22/10", "5/11", "12/11", "19/11", "26/11"]}, "-T02-TUT (4928)": {"startTimes": ["12:30"], "endTimes": ["13:15"], "days": [3], "locations": ["Institute of Chin Studies L1"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["3/9", "10/9", "17/9", "24/9", "8/10", "15/10", "22/10", "5/11", "12/11", "19/11", "26/11"]}, "-T03-TUT (4919)": {"startTimes": ["12:30"], "endTimes": ["13:15"], "days": [4], "locations": ["Tsang Shiu Tim Bldg 105"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["4/9", "11/9", "18/9", "25/9", "2/10", "9/10", "16/10", "23/10", "30/10", "6/11", "13/11", "20/11", "27/11"]}, "-T04-TUT (4929)": {"startTimes": ["13:30"], "endTimes": ["14:15"], "days": [4], "locations": ["Tsang Shiu Tim Bldg 105"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["4/9", "11/9", "18/9", "25/9", "2/10", "9/10", "16/10", "23/10", "30/10", "6/11", "13/11", "20/11", "27/11"]}, "-T05-TUT (4921)": {"startTimes": ["15:30"], "endTimes": ["16:15"], "days": [2], "locations": ["Lee Shau Kee Building 514"], "instructors": ["Mr. Michael SCHREIBER, \n\nMs. LAM Shuk Fong"], "meetingDates": ["2/9", "9/9", "16/9", "23/9", "30/9", "14/10", "21/10", "28/10", "4/11", "11/11", "18/11", "25/11"]}}}, "assessments": {"Essay test or exam": "70", "Homework or assignment": "30"}}, {"code": "1020", "title": "Hong Kong Legal System", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "LLB Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "English:The development of Hong Kong's legal system is part of Hong Kong\u2019s story.

And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime \u2014 put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 \u2014 may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty\u2019s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as \u2018exclusive economic zone\u2019, \u2018archipelagic state\u2019, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research.

Individual cases increasingly occurred in which it became impossible to apply the relatively strict requirements of the Common Law while simultaneously achieving a result which accorded with basic requirements of justice. The response of the English legal system was to accommodate a parallel system of courts whose task was, in appropriate circumstances, to temper the application of the Common Law with principles derived from elementary considerations of fairness \u2013 or equity. Among the more important contributions of equity is the trust, which enables a person to acquire an enforceable interest in something when another person is the legal owner. The flexibility of equity and the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery also allowed equity to develop a series of remedies which were far more powerful than the common law: amongst these the injunction, specific performance, equitable account and the doctrine of subrogation are very important today in a commercial context. Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong.

The importance of the wishes of the person who creates the trust, the settler or testator, has also changed as the Court has been willing to vary the terms of the trust in various circumstances. Apart from trusts, Equity has also provided modern commerce with the basis of professional relationships: the fiduciary. The company director owes a fiduciary duty to the company and the remedies available to the company for his wrongdoings are equitable. Similarly professional duties of confidentiality are based on fiduciary principles. Over the centuries, whereas the common law was restricted to the remedy of damages, Equity developed a series of flexible and powerful remedies, such as: subpoena; equitable account; subrogation; and rescission. Foremost amongst these was the injunction, which can be used to stop someone doing something or make them do it.

And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime \u2014 put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 \u2014 may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty\u2019s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as \u2018exclusive economic zone\u2019, \u2018archipelagic state\u2019, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research.

Students will learn how colonial rules interacted with native Chinese law in Hong Kong, the difficulties of transplanting rules from one culture into another, and some aspects of the second-generation review of transplanted rules currently taking place. A main focus of the course will be to examine how rules (colonial, statutory and regulatory) have interacted with judicial action. We will in particular see how in the 20th Century, statutes and rules steadily came to dominate the field, leading to a convergence both of many individual bodies of rules and of the larger systems of Common and Civil Law. In sum, two sources of change will be studied: influence between legal systems and change within legal systems in response to changing circumstances. We will conclude with an investigation of the convergence of Common Law and Civil Law based not on geography and heritage, but on the type of problems addressed by a given law, the density of information and expert commentary available, and the existence of competent rule-making bodies. The course should give students a solid grasp of how legal systems can influence each other at the international level.

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties (European Union-China, U.S.-China\u2026) and other agreements with investment related provisions (Transpacific Partnership, Trilateral Treaty\u2026). Foreign investments play a pivotal role in most countries\u2019 political economies. The benefits of inward investments include, amongst others, the following: developing a sound economic structure; increasing and diversifying manufacturing; offering novel and more developed services; creating employment; and bringing innovative technology. Conversely, outward investment can bring long-term capital gains to the home country, help to build economic and political ties with other nations, and, in some cases, to ensure access to critical natural resources. In order to encourage cross-border capital flows, countries have taken various steps such as revising their domestic legal frameworks to liberalise rules on inward and outward investment and to create special regimes which provide incentives and protections for foreign investment. Alongside the developments in domestic laws, countries have also taken bilateral and multilateral action including entering into trade and/or investment agreements. In spite of political and ideological disparities, by the end of the twentieth century an international regime of foreign investment had emerged. Since the conclusion of the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) in 1959, international investment agreements (IIAs) have significantly increased both in number and importance. As of Ausgust 1, 2016, there are over 3,200 IIAs (including treaties concluded by the HK Government which are different from the PRC treaties). The primary purpose of these proliferating norms is to \u2018provide stability and security for foreign investors by limiting the range of legitimate government interventions in their affairs and by providing compensation should these norms be violated\u2019. In exchange for these commitments, states would receive investment inflows and the benefits of the alleged consequent economic development. Recent years have witnessed the rapidly evolving dynamics of foreign investment and trade in Asia as investment into and within the region grows rapidly. Countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea are now increasingly investing abroad; at the same time, many developing countries in the region are looking to leverage foreign investment for economic growth. These trends raise new policy questions for the home and host countries which are seeking to maximise the benefits of such outward and inward investment, while also mitigating the potential social and environmental costs.This course aims to introduce the students to the public international law standards for the treatment of foreign investments. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of international investment law, through lectures, case study, in-class discussions and group presentations.

The law \u2013 both at the international and national levels \u2013 has a crucial role to play in achieving these energy policy objectives. Creating an appropriate regulatory environment for energy trade and investment is a highly complex exercise \u2013 but the success of this task is essential in determining the ability of states to fuel economic development, ensure social welfare and protect the environment. On the one hand, governments require a certain level of regulatory flexibility to react to rapid developments on the global energy markets.

The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong.

In addition to developing writing skills and discovering their individual academic voice, students will develop a sense of different academic writing conventions and will be able to distinguish between and draft the thesis and academic articles (which, to the extent it does not interfere with their thesis research and writing, they may wish to write during their years as Master\u2019s/doctoral students).", "outcome": "By the end of this course, students should be able to:-\u00a0Write well-structured and clear academic texts in an appropriate style-\u00a0Write grammatically correct sentences with good punctuation, diction and paragraph development-\u00a0Start to find and define their individual academic voice-\u00a0Engage in constructive critique of their own and research postgraduate colleagues' written work-\u00a0Generate texts that may be the basis of actual thesis and/or academic article drafts-\u00a0Present orally their academic writing effectively", "syllabus": "Please refer to the course outline.", "required_readings": "Please refer to the course outline.", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2025-26 Term 1": {"-C01-CLW (2239)": {"startTimes": ["TBA"], "endTimes": ["TBA"], "days": ["TBA"], "locations": ["Lee Shau Kee Building 508"], "instructors": ["Staff"], "meetingDates": ["01/09/2025 - 24/11/2025"]}}}}, {"code": "7004", "title": "Legal Education Practicum", "career": "Postgraduate - Research", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Seminar", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Law", "requirements": "For students in MPhil Laws or PhD Laws", "description": "This course equips research postgraduate students (RPg students) with the skills and the necessary confidence to engage in law school classroom teaching as well as to reflect critically and constructively upon that teaching.
