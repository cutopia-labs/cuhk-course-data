Put it simply, comparative public policy is to explain policy outcomes by comparing different political units, whether they are national or sub-national governments. The course offers foundational concepts and approaches in the field of comparative public policy, and begins with an introduction to the concepts of understanding comparative public policy. Questions and issues such as why comparative approach is needed to the study of public policy; What the significances and benefits of doing this are; And how it is conducted comparatively will be tackled, among many others. Then we will focus on a few substantive policies subsequently such as anti-corruption policy, higher educational policy, housing policy, poverty issue and aging policy. All these illustrate and demonstrate the importance, significance and insight drawn from the comparative study of public policy. In short, both conceptual ideas and empirical policies will be studied to enhance our understanding of public policies in a comparative manner. Moreover, practical implications and lessons will be drawn and learned. Last, but not the least, group presentations will be encouraged in the final weeks of the class. The number of groups will depend on the size of the class and the presentations should provide an excellent forum for us to engage in an active mode of discussion. Ideas can be tested; points will be made, and, above all, judgements shall be formed.
