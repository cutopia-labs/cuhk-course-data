They will focus on how those in power seek to maintain that power, in part by justifying it through art and literature. They will also focus on the struggle that exists between the working class and the ruling (elite) class. \u00a0 Postcolonial Literary Theory Students learn to read for an awareness of representation of non-Europeans as exotic or \u2018Other\u2019 in literature. They also learn to focus on language to see if the colonizer's language is permanently tainted, to write in it involves acquiescence in colonial structures. Other topics include observing the identity as doubled or unstable (identify with colonizer and colonized) in literature, and also learn to be aware of cross-cultural interactions within literary work.These topics are transferrable to various disciplines in the Faculty of Arts. These concepts are also universal in understanding the trends in humanities.

The topic list is broad, including the physician-patient relationship, narrative medicine and storytelling, intercultural communication, stereotyping in the health professions, ideas about death and dying (as they relate to spiritual beliefs and organ donation), the pitfalls and potential of integrated medicine, the management of medical information in the media and how the Internet impacts patients and doctors, amongst other topics. Particularly, the course is designed to focus on developing students\u2019 skills in close reading, attentive listening, critical thinking, impromptu speaking, analyzing videos and texts, and reflective writing. There will be one assigned reading and topic each week and students should be prepared to present the texts to the class and/or engage in panel discussions about the texts.", "outcome": "By the end of this course, students will have further developed their skills in:1.
