As protein molecules are organized in a structural hierarchy, topology diagrams will be used to illustrate the motifs of protein structure. In particular, the alpha-domain structures, beta structures and the alpha/beta structures will be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0 The key concepts of thermodynamics and kinetics in the process of protein folding and the stabilization of protein structure will be illustrated.Structure-Function Relationship in Selected Proteins:\u00a0 Specific examples will be used to illustrate the general structure of membrane proteins.\u00a0 Chaperone are proteins that help correct protein folding while ubiquitin, together with the proteasome system, is responsible for protein degradation. They will be discussed with respect to their structure-function relationship. Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene activity. Different DNA binding motifs will be introduced.\u00a0\u00a0 Proteins can be engineered to improve their properties.\u00a0 Methods like DNA shuffling will be discussed.Protein-Protein Interaction:\u00a0 The different methods for studying protein-protein interaction will be introduced. Among the methods are qualitative ones like co-immunoprecipitation, chemical cross linking, yeast two hybrid system, fluorescent resonance energy transfer, as well as quantitative ones like surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry.\u00a0\u00a0 The use of mass spectrometry in the identification of protein will be discussed.Introduction to Enzymes:\u00a0 The basic characteristics of enzymes as biocatalysts, for example the specificity, ability to be regulated and the catalytic power will be introduced. Ribonucleic acids having catalytic activities will be mentioned. The enzyme nomenclature system and the requirement of coenzymes and metals ions for various enzymatic reactions will also be discussed.Enzyme Kinetics:\u00a0 Different methods for measuring enzyme activities and the precautions needed when performing enzyme assays will be discussed. Michaelis-Menten enzyme steady state kinetics will be covered, with particular emphasis on the significance of the Km and kcat values. Different types of enzyme inhibitors, including allosteric ones, will be introduced. The various means by which enzyme activities can be regulated will be mentioned. Examples will be given to illustrate how the different amino acid residues in the active site of the enzyme contribute to the activity of the enzyme.Clinical and Industrial Enzymology:\u00a0 This session will introduce the use of enzymes in different clinical applications, for example, the plasma enzyme activity assay as a diagnostic tool, the use of enzyme as a reagent to measure the concentration of certain metabolites, the use of enzyme inhibitor as drugs and the use of enzyme itself as a therapeutic agent.

This session attempts to introduce to students different fluorescence techniques including the use of fluorometer, fluorescence plate reader, confocal microscope, and flow cytometer for a number of biochemical analyses.Ion Exchange Chromatography:\u00a0 Chromatography is a technique which depends on the distribution of a molecule between two different phases, a stationary phase and a mobile phase.\u00a0 Depending on the stationary phase used, there are different kinds of chromatography which allow for separation of molecules with different properties.\u00a0 In the experiment, ion exchange chromatography will be used to separate three different proteins.Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Discontinuous Gel Electrophoresis:\u00a0 SDS is an anionic detergent which binds strongly to protein at a constant ratio such that all the SDS-treated proteins are negatively charged. Besides having the same charge to mass ratio, the SDS-treated proteins also have the same shape. Consequently, when electrophoresed in the molecular sieving polyacrylamide gel, they will be separated according to size and their molecular weight can be determined with reference to the standards.Separation of Sub-cellular Components by Differential Centrifugation:\u00a0 Differential centrifugation will be used to separate sub-cellular components for biochemical analysis.\u00a0 Different sub-cellular components, such as the nucleus and the cell membrane, have different sedimentation properties and therefore, they can be differentially sedimented to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. In this experiment, we will attempt to separate key cellular components (the nucleus, the mitochondria/membrane and the cytosol fractions) using a simple centrifuge. The experiment was designed to show that by varying the parameters of centrifugation, one could selectively separate cellular components into fractions with distinctive biochemical characteristics.Crystallization of Lysozyme: The X-ray crystallography is a very important technique to study the three-dimensional structure of proteins. A good X-ray diffraction pattern, however, requires a large protein crystal that is free of contaminants and aggregation. In this experiment, students will acquire the basic skills of producing a crystal of lysozyme. In addition, the effects of different protein and salt concentrations on lysozyme crystallization will also be investigated.\u7192\u5149\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9748\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u904e\u4f7f\u7528\u7192\u5149\u6aa2\u6e2c\u76ee\u6a19\u5206\u5b50\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5404\u985e\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b78\u548c\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u6703\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7192\u5149\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7192\u5149\u6a5f\uff0c\u7192\u5149\u5fae\u5b54\u677f\u6aa2\u6e2c\u5100\uff0c\u6fc0\u5149\u5171\u805a\u7126\u986f\u5fae\u93e1\uff0c\u6d41\u5f0f\u7d30\u80de\u5100\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u96e2\u5b50\u4ea4\u63db\u5c64\u6790\uff1a\u5c64\u6790\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u4f9d\u8cf4\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u76f8\u548c\u6d41\u52d5\u76f8\u4e4b\u9593\u5206\u4f48\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u76f8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8cea\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u96e2\u3002\u5728\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u5c07\u6703\u5229\u7528\u96e2\u5b50\u4ea4\u63db\u5c64\u6790\u6cd5\u5206\u96e2\u4e09\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8cea\u3002\u5341\u4e8c\u70f7\u57fa\u786b\u9178\u9209 -

Students will learn how to observe, collect, analyze and evaluate evidence found at crime scenes. The first part addresses the identification of biological fluids such as blood, semen, and saliva from crime scene. The emphasis will be on the biochemical technologies used in the presumptive and confirmatory tests. The second part covers DNA analysis using RFLP and PCR-STR typing methods, interpretation of DNA typing results, and court presentation of such biological evidence. Mitochondrial DNA typing and Y chromosome DNA typing will also be discussed. It is anticipated that students will apply the biochemistry knowledge they have acquired in junior years in the course.
