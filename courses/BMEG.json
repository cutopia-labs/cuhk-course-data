The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows.
