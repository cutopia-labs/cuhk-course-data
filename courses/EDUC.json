To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations, teachers must understand the current reality of school administration, their own personal weaknesses, commit to career-long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness. This course is designed to help teachers understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In others words it aims to help teachers become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways. First, its aims to nurture teachers\u2019 awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Second, it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life.

This course sees education as the site for the construction of and contests involving gender and sexualities. It also deconstructs dominant epistemologies, and introduces students to research concerning gender-differentiated modes of learning.

By showcasing both local and global best practices, the course offers a comprehensive perspective that equips students with the ability to drive positive change, lead initiatives, employ diversified pedagogical approaches, and evaluate curriculum innovations to optimize student learning outcomes.There are five big questions guiding the course:1. How can we adopt a dynamic approach to curriculum development that fosters innovative learning experiences, captivating, and motivating students?2. How can change agents drive curriculum development and cultivate a culture of innovation in schools to create dynamic and meaningful learning experiences?3. What are the key principles, models, and strategies that drive the development of dynamic curricula?4.
