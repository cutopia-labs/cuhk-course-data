Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations, teachers must understand the current reality of school administration, their own personal weaknesses, commit to career-long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness. This course is designed to help teachers understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In others words it aims to help teachers become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways. First, its aims to nurture teachers\u2019 awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Second, it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in the course are: understanding teachers\u2019 role and the complexity of the school organization, developing personal mastery and personal vision in education, systems thinking and problem solving in the organization and in the classroom, learning shared vision and team learning skills, leading and managing change in school, etc.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3270", "title": "Engendering Education", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "2.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Fac Office of Education", "requirements": "Not for students who have taken GDRS2004 or UGEC2672", "description": "Drawing on sociological and socio-psychological perspectives, this course tries to sensitize students to the gender implications underlying educational structures and processes.

This course sees education as the site for the construction of and contests involving gender and sexualities. It also deconstructs dominant epistemologies, and introduces students to research concerning gender-differentiated modes of learning.

Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should or can teach their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and justice as embodied in \u2018whole-person education\u2019. Key concepts like human rights, rule of law, democracy, nation-state, and globalization will be compared. How these concepts can be taught and learnt in daily classroom will be discussed.

They will delve into a wide array of innovative approaches, such as curriculum integration, cooperative learning, experiential learning, project-based learning, and inquiry-based learning. The course will also cover essential aspects of implementing and evaluating dynamic curricula, such as assessing student outcomes and gathering valuable feedback from stakeholders. Students will gain insights into administration and risk management considerations crucial to effectively implementing innovative curriculum designs. By showcasing both local and global best practices, the course offers a comprehensive perspective that equips students with the ability to drive positive change, lead initiatives, employ diversified pedagogical approaches, and evaluate curriculum innovations to optimize student learning outcomes.There are five big questions guiding the course:1. How can we adopt a dynamic approach to curriculum development that fosters innovative learning experiences, captivating, and motivating students?2. How can change agents drive curriculum development and cultivate a culture of innovation in schools to create dynamic and meaningful learning experiences?3. What are the key principles, models, and strategies that drive the development of dynamic curricula?4. What innovative approaches and methodologies, such as integrated curriculum, collaborative learning, project-based, and inquiry-based learning, can be used to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes?5.
