The first course focuses on developing the general knowledge and skills a teacher needs for organizing an effective mathematics lesson. A wide range of general topics of mathematics pedagogy will be covered, including: aims and objectives of mathematics education; the evolution of mathematics curricula in the current educational reform; theories of mathematics learning and instruction; models of mathematics teaching; preparation of mathematics lessons and classroom techniques through microteaching; use of instructional aids and manipulatives; catering for learning diversities; and evaluation of learning effectiveness.", "outcome": "By the end of this course, students will be able to:\u00a01. understand the content and the rationale behind the Hong Kong secondary school mathematics curriculum;\u00a02. construct lesson plans by selecting and sequencing \"big ideas\" to teach in school mathematics;\u00a03. determine prerequisite knowledge and skills for learning different mathematics topics;\u00a04. use effective teaching methods and instructional aids such as experiments and models to teach mathematics concepts;\u00a05. identify the common difficulties in mathematics learning among secondary school students;\u00a06. construct tests and other diagnosis to evaluate the effectiveness of mathematics learning and teaching\u00a0\u00a0\u5b78\u751f\u4fee\u7562\u672c\u79d1\u5f8c\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\uff1a\u00a01. \u4e86\u89e3\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u5b78\u6578\u5b78\u8ab2\u7a0b\u80cc\u5f8c\u4e4b\u7406\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u6240\u6db5\u84cb\u5167\u5bb9\u00a02. \u5b78\u6703\u900f\u904e\u64b0\u64c7\u53ca\u92ea\u6392\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cd\u8981\u6578\u5b78\u601d\u60f3\u4f86\u8a2d\u8a08\u6559\u6848\u00a03. \u638c\u63e1\u4e0d\u540c\u6578\u5b78\u8ab2\u984c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58\u53ca\u6280\u80fd\u00a04. \u904b\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6559\u5b78\u6cd5\u5982\u5be6\u9a57\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u6559\u6388\u6578\u5b78\u6982\u5ff5\u00a05. \u660e\u6670\u4e2d\u5b78\u751f\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u5b78\u7fd2\u56f0\u96e3\u00a06. \u900f\u904e\u6e2c\u8a66\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u8a55\u4f30\u6578\u5b78\u6559\u8207\u5b78\u4e4b\u6548\u80fd", "syllabus": "For reference only, please refer to the course outline of respective instructor for details\u00a01.
