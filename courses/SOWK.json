Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life\u2014after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, \u201cHow can I live with the grief?\u201d This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.

It is not creative arts therapy training, but exploring the resources of expressive arts for facilitating social work practice. The course is designed for social work students who are interested in learning the application of arts in counseling, group, and community work. It is also appropriate for those wishing to awake the seeds of creativity and make use of their inner resources for both personal growth and professional development. Expressive arts are powerful verbal, nonverbal, and imaginative tools for self-expression and communication. This arts-based social work practice is action-oriented and process-focused. Students have an opportunity to experiment the use of arts for creative exploration and self-understanding so that they can synthesize their personal experience with conceptual learning.Advisory: For majors only", "outcome": "Upon the completion of this course, students are expected to be able to\u00a0\u00a0I.
