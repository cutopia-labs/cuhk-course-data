Looking at the variances of urban modernity, we will examine how blueprints for modernist, global, creative, and smart cities are articulated within the greater Asia region. Such templates are often standardized, top-down visions for urban renewal, economic growth, and technological progress with contrasting degrees of triumphalism and failure. The focus on metropolitan areas and city clusters offers a way of thinking beyond (or beneath) the nation. Uncovering characteristic tropes in film and visual cultures of the city, we will explore how multiple modernities are produced, disseminated, consumed, and reproduced through different media ecologies such as cinema, photography, visual art, architecture, maps, comic books, video games, and social media. Embracing a more expansive definition, we will regard Asia as sprawling, archipelagic, and diverse, inclusive of the marginalized, diasporic populations of Southeast Asia.We will ask: How can the complex flows, processes, and rhythms of a modern metropolis be visualized? What social and economic changes prevail in the shift to modes of governmentality characteristic of the conditions of neoliberal capitalism, media convergence, and immaterial production? How do urban infrastructure and architecture manage the dynamisms and tensions of modern flows and rhythms to reshape work productivity, public order, and collective memory? How are the voices and rights of the burgeoning class of cosmopolitan consumers and transnational migrants delimited and excluded from the configuration and operation of the modern Asian city?", "outcome": "1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To become acquainted with the key issues and debates in cultural studies of Asian modernities2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To explain how cultural and media representations visualize and problematize the complex social, economic, and historical conditions of different Asian Cities3) To apply a comparative, transnational lens to examine the distinct histories and cultures of diverse spatial environments and media ecologies across the greater Asian region", "syllabus": "Week 1: Visualizing the Asian MetropolisWeek 2: Parallel ModernitiesWeek 3: Spectacular Architecture and Urban SpeculationWeek 4: Neon NoirWeek 5: Cinematic UrbanismWeek 6: Urban Informality and Slum VoyeurismWeek 7: Migrant Labor IntimaciesWeek 8: City Museums and Heritage SpacesWeek 9: Creative Economies and Public ScreensWeek 10: Street Mapping and Locative MediaWeek 11: Special Economic ZonesWeek 12: Consultations on final projectWeek 13: Field tripWeek 14: Presentation on final project", "required_readings": " Jonathan Bach, \u201cShenzhen: From Exception to Rule,\u201d in Learning from Shenzhen: China\u2019s Post-Mao Experiment from Special Zone to Model City, eds.

What is the labor, environmental, and social issues behind the use of AI? Where does human agency lie in the world undergirded by various systems of machines, networks of computers, and the cloud? This course introduces key intellectual commitments of digital studies and its recent engagement with AI ethics, including untangling the stories we tell ourselves about human uniqueness in face of machine intelligence, the material infrastructure of information, and the ethics issues that arise in the evolving landscape of AI infusion.

In the age of the Anthropocene, challenges arising from global environmental change are numerous: extreme weather, land and water pollution, species extinction, toxic contamination, just to name a few. These challenges are now raising concerns both from scholars in the natural science and from the humanities and the social sciences. This course works on a rapidly growing field of Enviornmental Humanities constituted by the work of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines including history, literature, philosophy, cultural studies, religion studies, arts.It aims to provide students with some recent methodological and theoretical approaches of understanding the anthropocene, including cultural ecology, environmental history, science studies, poststructuralist cultural studies, and eco-feminism.

Nevertheless, as the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, protection policy, law-making and media portrayals of animals are the hot topics in our (post)modern culture, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of an advanced human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.", "outcome": "On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to: \u00a01.

Leaving Zootopia \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City (Lecture C1-C4)\u00a0Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. \u00a0\u00a0Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in animation, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. \u00a0\u00a0Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "required_readings": "Area A - Entering Jurassic World \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure\u00a0\u00a0Castricano, Jodey. \u201cIntroduction: Animal Subjects in a Posthuman World\u201d In Animal Subjects: An Ethical Reader in a Posthuman World. edited by Jodey Castricano, 1-32.

In this course we will examine them in both breadth and depth; topics discussed include (post)coloniality, transborder, city and space awareness, variegated localism, China factor, cosmopolitanism, mega-region, generation, social movement, etc. While the topics are not in strict chronological order and each has a narrative of its own, they are unfolded in a sequence that overall form a historical picture of Hong Kong and its discourse formation. For each topic, students will be introduced with theoretical concepts, narrative and representations involved. Students will also get to know some key scholars involved in the discussion. Not shun from taking position, students are encouraged to keep open-minded and evaluate the issues critically, particularly to treat the discourses as ongoing process rather than static products. While we focus on one topic per week for explication purpose, students should note the intricate relationship among the related topics, and keep in mind to build the linkage and dialogue among them.",

affinities and linkages among cultural processes, geopolitical conditions, and media representations within the greater Asian region, broadly defined. Expanding its scope beyond a single nation, race, or language, the course builds on the comparativist work of Benedict Anderson, Chen Kuan-hsing, Aihwa Ong, and Anna Tsing in Asian Studies and Inter-Asia Cultural Studies to uncover the multiplicity of diverse Asias. Its focal points are keywords, objects, and images that would have social resonance in particular locations and societies. Examining their global interchange through an array of print, audiovisual, and digital media, it focuses on their variance in form, use, and meaning across distinct spatial environments and historical periods with a spotlight on vernacular perspectives and experiences.In each semester, the course will explore a combination of the following questions: How are different understandings of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 development,\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019 exemplified by contrasting conditions of political, social, and historical transformation? How are the racial, ethnic, or religious identities of Chinese-ness or Muslim-ness shaped by diaspora, tourism, and media? How is the experience and consumption of nostalgia configured by particular conditions of intensifying economic and emotional instability? How is colonialism a system that exceeds the dichotomy between East and West to encompass intraregional hierarchies centered on the economic and cultural superiority of Japan or China?

It describes communities built by like-minded people in any aspect of popular culture, such as sports, movies, television dramas or music, who actively produce creative content for their uses. As Henry Jenkins once suggested, most fan cultures show elements of participatory culture, as fan communities enjoy their own readings of popular culture and encourage artistic creations and expression. While scholars of popular culture criticise consumers of popular content as \"disciplined readers\" who are being manipulated by the culture industry and follow suit the mass culture, scholars who underpinned the participation of fans consider popular culture consumers as poachers who appropriate ideas from the media text and reinterpret them in creative ways. Therefore, by focusing on fan activities, this field of study provides gateways for further investigation of both individual and collective human agency in media and popular culture through community building, mass consumption, subculture in mediascape and participatory culture. Through this course, students will learn the relationship between fan cultures concerning consumer culture, identity formation, gift economy, emotion economy etc., in contemporary mediascapes.", "outcome": " Trace the history of fan culture from the 19th Century to its recent developments.

A central concern is to transform Chinese visual arts into both modern and Chinese, representing an independent people and nation marching into modernity. Developed around the visual arts, the course would ultimately like to ask a political question: is there a national style? This course focuses primarily on the Chinese arts, but we will also pay attention to artistic movements outside China. We will explore different genres of visual arts as well as the overall social and political order of the time. In contrast to the traditional art history approach, this course is devoted to the investigation of how arts and politics became so mutually constitutive with each other in the Chinese context, and how the revolution discourse relied heavily on the arts to connect to the people. We will also explore how Maoist arts cannot be understood simply as political tool. In addition to providing a general overview of the development of arts, we will also investigate the meanings of artistic freedom in China, and explore the identity of artists and authors under an official ideology in which collectivity is deemed much more important than individuals. At a time when nationalism perpetuates Chinese society, a revisit of the \u201cnational style\u201d of Chinese arts developed in the twentieth century invites students to reflect on the meanings of Chinese arts beyond narrow-minded Sino-centric frameworks. We could instead go back to some basic aesthetic values and concepts such as emancipation, democracy, and plurality. This course is as much one of art history as one of political and intellectual history.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "6001", "title": "The Making of Contemporary Culture", "career": "Postgraduate - Research", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Cultural Studies", "requirements": "For students in MPhil-PhD Cultural Studies", "description": "An introductory seminar to all postgraduate research students beginning in the field of cultural studies, with the special focus on the understanding of contemporary culture.
