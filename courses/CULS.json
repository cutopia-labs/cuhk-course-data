Looking at the variances of urban modernity, we will examine how blueprints for modernist, global, creative, and smart cities are articulated within the greater Asia region. Such templates are often standardized, top-down visions for urban renewal, economic growth, and technological progress with contrasting degrees of triumphalism and failure. The focus on metropolitan areas and city clusters offers a way of thinking beyond (or beneath) the nation. Uncovering characteristic tropes in film and visual cultures of the city, we will explore how multiple modernities are produced, disseminated, consumed, and reproduced through different media ecologies such as cinema, photography, visual art, architecture, maps, comic books, video games, and social media. Embracing a more expansive definition, we will regard Asia as sprawling, archipelagic, and diverse, inclusive of the marginalized, diasporic populations of Southeast Asia.We will ask: How can the complex flows, processes, and rhythms of a modern metropolis be visualized? What social and economic changes prevail in the shift to modes of governmentality characteristic of the conditions of neoliberal capitalism, media convergence, and immaterial production? How do urban infrastructure and architecture manage the dynamisms and tensions of modern flows and rhythms to reshape work productivity, public order, and collective memory? How are the voices and rights of the burgeoning class of cosmopolitan consumers and transnational migrants delimited and excluded from the configuration and operation of the modern Asian city?", "outcome": "1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To become acquainted with the key issues and debates in cultural studies of Asian modernities2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To explain how cultural and media representations visualize and problematize the complex social, economic, and historical conditions of different Asian Cities3) To apply a comparative, transnational lens to examine the distinct histories and cultures of diverse spatial environments and media ecologies across the greater Asian region", "syllabus": "Week 1: Visualizing the Asian MetropolisWeek 2: Parallel ModernitiesWeek 3: Spectacular Architecture and Urban SpeculationWeek 4: Neon NoirWeek 5: Cinematic UrbanismWeek 6: Urban Informality and Slum VoyeurismWeek 7: Migrant Labor IntimaciesWeek 8: City Museums and Heritage SpacesWeek 9: Creative Economies and Public ScreensWeek 10: Street Mapping and Locative MediaWeek 11: Special Economic ZonesWeek 12: Consultations on final projectWeek 13: Field tripWeek 14: Presentation on final project", "required_readings": " Jonathan Bach, \u201cShenzhen: From Exception to Rule,\u201d in Learning from Shenzhen: China\u2019s Post-Mao Experiment from Special Zone to Model City, eds.

The course may explore how AI relies on digital data and processes, as well as the implications of the digital transformation on society.\u00a0Cybernetics: Cybernetics is the study of systems, control, and communication in animals, machines, and organizations. This course examines the history of cybernetic and how the military roots have morphed into both popular culture (cyberpunk) and everyday life.\u00a0Algorithm: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. The course would likely delve into the significance of algorithms in AI, the mythical association of algorithms, and the fetishization of this term in various commercial practices.\u00a0Ghost Work: Ghost work refers to the often invisible and under-appreciated human labor that supports AI systems, such as data labeling and content moderation. The course may investigate the ethical and labor-related aspects of ghost work.\u00a0Infrastructural Turn: This concept focuses on the environmental implications of AI infrastructure, including data centers and energy consumption. Students might explore the environmental concerns associated with the growth of AI technologies.\u00a0Geopolitics of AI: The course would likely examine the global political and economic dimensions of AI, including questions of power, influence, and competition among nations and corporations in the AI domain.\u00a0Artificial Communication: AI's capacity to communicate is a central theme. The course may emphasize that AI is not about intelligence but also about the ways in which AI systems communicate with humans and other systems.\u00a0Consent and Surveillance: Consent relates to the ethical and legal aspects of data collection and use in AI systems. Surveillance explores how AI technologies can be used for monitoring and its implications for privacy and civil liberties.\u00a0Chatbots Disciplines: This concept may involve an examination of how chatbots and conversational AI shape human cognition, social interaction, and information consumption, and how they are integrated into various disciplines.\u00a0AI Auditing: Students might explore the need for auditing AI systems to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in their decision-making processes. This relates to addressing biases and ethical concerns.\u00a0AI Fairness: AI fairness deals with ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate or reinforce societal biases. The course may delve into methods and principles for achieving fairness in AI algorithms and applications.Overall, this course would provide a comprehensive understanding of AI's multifaceted impact on society, covering technological, ethical, labour-related, environmental, and geopolitical dimensions, among others.\u00a0", "required_readings": "The reading list will be updated if deem necessary.

among cultural processes, geopolitical conditions, and media representations within the greater Asian region, broadly defined. Expanding its scope beyond a single nation, race, or language, the course builds on the comparativist work of Benedict Anderson, Chen Kuan-hsing, Aihwa Ong, and Anna Tsing in Asian Studies and Inter-Asia Cultural Studies to uncover the multiplicity of diverse Asias. Its focal points are keywords, objects, and images that would have social resonance in particular locations and societies. Examining their global interchange through an array of print, audiovisual, and digital media, it focuses on their variance in form, use, and meaning across distinct spatial environments and historical periods with a spotlight on vernacular perspectives and experiences.In each semester, the course will explore a combination of the following questions: How are different understandings of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 development,\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019 exemplified by contrasting conditions of political, social, and historical transformation? How are the racial, ethnic, or religious identities of Chinese-ness or Muslim-ness shaped by diaspora, tourism, and media? How is the experience and consumption of nostalgia configured by particular conditions of intensifying economic and emotional instability? How is colonialism a system that exceeds the dichotomy between East and West to encompass intraregional hierarchies centered on the economic and cultural superiority of Japan or China? How have interactions and exchanges among intellectuals, revolutionaries, and migrants constituted imaginaries of \u2018pan-Asianism\u2019? With this transnational orientation, the course hopes to expand the locus of the discussion beyond Asia to encompass its trans-oceanic connections with Africa and Latin America.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5227", "title": "Fandom and Participatory Culture", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Cultural Studies", "requirements": "For students in MA in Intercultural Studies and MA in Cultural Management.", "description": "Fandom, or fan culture, is a term that accompanies lots of stigma in the past and is now a fancy entry into cyberspace subculture in the web 2.0(or even web 3.0) era. It describes communities built by like-minded people in any aspect of popular culture, such as sports, movies, television dramas or music, who actively produce creative content for their uses. As Henry Jenkins once suggested, most fan cultures show elements of participatory culture, as fan communities enjoy their own readings of popular culture and encourage artistic creations and expression. While scholars of popular culture criticise consumers of popular content as \"disciplined readers\" who are being manipulated by the culture industry and follow suit the mass culture, scholars who underpinned the participation of fans consider popular culture consumers as poachers who appropriate ideas from the media text and reinterpret them in creative ways. Therefore, by focusing on fan activities, this field of study provides gateways for further investigation of both individual and collective human agency in media and popular culture through community building, mass consumption, subculture in mediascape and participatory culture. Through this course, students will learn the relationship between fan cultures concerning consumer culture, identity formation, gift economy, emotion economy etc., in contemporary mediascapes.", "outcome": " Trace the history of fan culture from the 19th Century to its recent developments.

A central concern is to transform Chinese visual arts into both modern and Chinese, representing an independent people and nation marching into modernity. Developed around the visual arts, the course would ultimately like to ask a political question: is there a national style? This course focuses primarily on the Chinese arts, but we will also pay attention to artistic movements outside China. We will explore different genres of visual arts as well as the overall social and political order of the time. In contrast to the traditional art history approach, this course is devoted to the investigation of how arts and politics became so mutually constitutive with each other in the Chinese context, and how the revolution discourse relied heavily on the arts to connect to the people. We will also explore how Maoist arts cannot be understood simply as political tool. In addition to providing a general overview of the development of arts, we will also investigate the meanings of artistic freedom in China, and explore the identity of artists and authors under an official ideology in which collectivity is deemed much more important than individuals. At a time when nationalism perpetuates Chinese society, a revisit of the \u201cnational style\u201d of Chinese arts developed in the twentieth century invites students to reflect on the meanings of Chinese arts beyond narrow-minded Sino-centric frameworks. We could instead go back to some basic aesthetic values and concepts such as emancipation, democracy, and plurality.

This course asks students to throw away old conceptualization that human makes things and history. It turns the question around to ask how \u201cthings\u201d make people and how to have a new imagination of world politics and social justice based on new connection between human and non-human \u201cthings.\u201d Can things, such as technology, corporeality and matters be understood as having a form of subjectivity, being, and agency of their own?
