A community nutritionist assesses and monitors not only physiological and dietary, but also social, cultural, technological and psychological information from many sources to determine needs and identify opportunities for sound, appropriate interventions that improve nutritional health. Because well-conceived nutrition surveys are basic tools for prioritising problems and deciding program plans and evaluations to provide better nutrition services to the public, the course will first introduce community nutrition survey design to the students.
