Signing varieties\u00a0 Signing is a cover term for a wide array of varieties which reflects at the one end of the continuum the grammar of spoken languages and at the other end the grammar of natural sign languages. Examples of signing varieties include\u00a0 natural sign languages, manually coded spoken languages, fingerspelling, cued speech, tactile signing, etc.   Sign Language Acquisition\u00a0 It covers different types of acquisition processes involving sign languages, which may be L1 acquisition of sign languages by deaf or hearing individuals in a monolingual fashion, or bimodal bilingual acquisition of both a sign language and a spoken language in early childhood \u00a0or entering adulthood.  \u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "There will be:\u00a01.

Common Phonological Processes in Sign Languages\u00a0 This unit presents common phonological processes and changes that have been found in the world\u2019s sign languages. Students will practice how to identify processes that result in historical changes and sociolinguistic variations.

Handshape as a phonological parameter This unit presents the generalizations that have been made about how handshapes are configured and constrained in sign languages and how phonological models have attempted to account for these patterns.   Location as a phonological parameter This unit looks into the subcategories of locations, their respective characteristics and how they can be represented in phonological models.   Movement as a phonological parameter This unit presents the different types of movements and their characteristics. It also reviews the controversies surrounding the phonological status of movement as an independent category.

Language acquisition beyond this period displays diversity in ultimate attainment.   Impoverished Input Linguistic data that is supposedly sensitive enough to trigger language acquisition is neither perceived nor processed efficiently due to hearing loss. Alternatively, the so-called language data that deaf children are exposed to show intrinsic characteristics that mar sensitive linguistic input.   Sign bilingualism vs bimodal bilingualism Sign Bilingualism refers to a form of education philosophy for the deaf that promotes use of sign language in education to nurture the \u2018L1\u2019 acquisition of deaf and hard-of-hearing children.

We will begin by examining the cognitive and neural foundations of language, comparing human language (both spoken and signed) to animal communication systems. From there, we will explore how the brain processes sign language, considering both typical and atypical language development in deaf and hearing signers.Key topics include sign language acquisition, the impact of linguistic and social disadvantage on language development, and the unique ways in which sign languages use space and visuospatial cognition. We will also investigate metaphor in sign language, sign language production and perception processes, and the relationship between sign language and written language processing.By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how sign language provides insight into broader questions about language, the mind, and human cognition, while also appreciating the unique ways in which sign languages interact with cognitive processes.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3002", "title": "Introduction to Sign Language Interpreting", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Linguistics & Mod Lang", "requirements": "Prerequisite: HKSL1002(2000), 1003(2050), 2001, 2002(3000), 2003(3050), 3001, 3002 or 3003", "description": "This course aims to provide a first introduction to sign interpreting to students with no prior training of the subject. Different modes of interpreting (e.g. sight translation, consecutive interpreting, simultaneous interpreting) and different models of sign language interpreting will be discussed. Discourses commonly found in local sign interpretation will be introduced (e.g. health, education, legal, social work, business and government, etc.). As an international development, the roles of Deaf interpreters to serve a broader purpose of communication are highlighted. Students are expected to be able to compare the development of local sign interpreting to that of Mainland China, Macau, and other countries.", "outcome": "Students completing this course will achieve a basic understanding that:\u00a01. Different modes of interpreting (e.g., sight translation, consecutive interpreting, and simultaneous interpreting) serve different purpose in communication access;\u00a02. Due to the minority status of the Deaf community and development of their service demand, different models of sign language interpreting are developed;\u00a03. Sign language interpreters have to equip themselves with and respond to different demands in the discourse setting;\u00a04. The roles of Deaf interpreters have been serving a broader purpose of language communication and it is also a form of human rights empowerment.", "syllabus": "   Topic Contents/fundamental concepts   Modes of Interpreting Sight translation, consecutive interpreting, and simultaneous interpreting serve different purpose in communication access. Sight translation provides instant access of written text to signers. Apart from competing in their time duration of interpreting, consecutive and simultaneous interpreting also differ in terms of its translation production clarity and appropriate use in different discourse.   Models of Sign Language Interpreting Answering the needs of service consumers, sign language interpreting models develop from helper model, machine model, communication facilitator model, bilingual-bicultural model, to nowadays ally model.   Discourses and Demands Different discourses call for different demands and qualifications of interpreters. They have to equip themselves with different knowledge, both encyclopedic and specialized, in order to relay the messages between their service consumers. Interpreters have to be alert to the register choice, as well as the intended and extended meaning implied in different discourses. On top of our everyday languages Hong Kong Sign Language and Cantonese, other languages, like English and Mandarin, might also be a different demand due to the post-colonial status of our city.   Deaf Interpreters Deaf interpreters have been introduced as unimodal interpreters in international conferences and as language expert in regional setting. The widely use of deaf interpreters has become an international trend and providing better access to the service consumers, especially for those who are Deaf-Blind, elderly Deaf, Deaf-plus, Deaf children, and Deaf foreigners. In terms of human rights empowerment, their roles also serve the purpose of Deaf individuals as language models.  ", "required_readings": "There will be:\u00a01.

Language acquisition beyond this period displays diversity in ultimate attainment.   Impoverished Input Linguistic data that is supposedly sensitive enough to trigger language acquisition is neither perceived nor processed efficiently due to hearing loss. Alternatively, the so-called language data that deaf children are exposed to show intrinsic characteristics that mar sensitive linguistic input.   Sign bilingualism vs bimodal bilingualism Sign Bilingualism refers to a form of education philosophy for the deaf that promotes use of sign language in education to nurture the \u2018L1\u2019 acquisition of deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Subsequent inclusion of spoken language in the education process is taken to be supporting L2 acquisition.
