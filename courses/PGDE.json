The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students\u2019 awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities. The course contents are as follows: 1) common goals of the school curriculum and student activities; 2) factors to consider in the design and administration of activities for formal student organizations; 3) activity guidelines, safety issues and risk assessment; 4) the types of internal and external chool activities and their implementation; 5) design and implementation of outdoor and outbound activities; 6) evaluation and documentation of student activities.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5101", "title": "Subject Curriculum and Teaching (Major: Chinese Language)", "career": "Postgraduate - PGDE", "units": "3.50 - 4.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "PGDE Prog Comm", "requirements": "For PGDE students only", "description": "This course is designed to equip the students with essential techniques and knowledge in the teaching of Chinese Language.

They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students\u2019 memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum reforms, greater significance is focused on extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities. Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students\u2019 awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations teachers must commit to career long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness, especially in terms of learning and teaching. This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Topics covered in this area include models of teacher development, stages of professional development, mentorship and internship, teacher appraisal and teacher professionalism.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the reason why adults, including parents and teachers, often avoid frank discussions about sexuality with young people. In short, adults themselves are trapped in various contradictions and myths about sex in society, which often renders them ineffective in communicating their views and values to youth, providing high-quality sexuality education, and proactively setting effective school policies pertaining to sexuality-related behaviors.This course discusses various issues related to sexuality, particularly those that are relevant to young people. In-service and pre-service teachers will directly confront and analyze related values, identify common confusions and myths associated with youth sexuality, and examine how their own values might influence the approach they take to providing youth with education related to sexuality. Special emphasis will be given to topics that have direct relevance to adolescents\u2019 sexual health and well-being, but are not typically covered in formal sexuality education curricula. Thus, as opposed to providing teaching methods or ready-to-use teaching materials for classroom demonstration, the primary aims are to raise educators\u2019 awareness of these issues and to help them to proactively clarify their own values in advance of conversations with students. In doing so, they can avoid confusion, misinformation, or unsupportive responses when interacting with youth. By having clear concepts and values regarding sexuality, they can communicate accurate information, provide affirming and supportive guidance to students and advocate for evidence-based school policies in a way that best fits their own instructional contexts.Grade Descriptor: A - Outstanding performance on all learning outcomesB - High performance on some learning outcomesC - Good performance on some learning outcomesD - Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomesF - Unsatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, or failure to meet specified assessment requirements(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.
