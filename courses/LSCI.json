Cryo-EM, a powerful technique involving rapid cooling of biological specimens in vitreous ice to preserve the structure for EM analysis, has become a dominant technique in the field of structural biology. Its board applications range from high-resolution structure determination of protein complexes using single particle analysis to visualization of subcellular structures in their native environment using tomography. On the other hand, X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool in studying small proteins and protein-drug interactions. Today, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography are indispensable and irreplaceable tools in research to reveal unprecedented architectural details of macromolecular assemblies that are invaluable to our mechanistic understanding of the biological world as well as drug discovery. This course will cover the fundamental principles and concepts with an emphasis on practical aspects of these two fundamental techniques. Basic techniques, such as specimen preparation, machine operation, data acquisition, computational image analysis and structure solving, 3D map interpretation, and model building will be covered.
