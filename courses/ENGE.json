Perhaps we are most aware of this kind of creativity when we read imaginative literature, whether classic or contemporary; but we also experience it directly in our own everyday language use. This course aims to foster new understandings of the various ways in which language influences and shapes the experiences of life common to all humanity. Students learn to analyze and appreciate a wide range of literary, linguistic and cultural phenomena, including the works of Hong Kong authors/poets who express themselves through English. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the ways in which language is structured and used creatively for different purposes in both local and global contexts. From a literary perspective, we study not only the traditional genres of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also film, song, and life writing. From a cultural perspective, we investigate how different texts and media are part of how we construct the world and define our evolving sense of self and our common humanity.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course students should be better able to: \u00a0- describe the central role of language in the creation and discovery of meaning; \u00a0- demonstrate a critical appreciation of the ways in which form, structure, and language shape meanings in literary texts; \u00a0- discuss the historical contexts of the globalization of English and their cultural consequences; \u00a0- synthesize information and ideas drawn from various sources, and evaluate critically opposing positions; \u00a0- describe how language and literature express individual and human values within an historical and sociocultural context; \u00a0- think imaginatively and analytically, and develop creative, ethical solutions to problems; \u00a0- express ideas with clarity, coherence, creativity, and fluency in both written and oral communication; \u00a0- use these new understandings as a basis for further studies in the humanities.", "syllabus": "Unit I: Imagination, critical thinking and creative expression through language and literature \u00a0\u2022 Conceptions of creativity and critical thinking \u00a0\u2022 Imagination and intellectual curiosity \u00a0\u2022 Culture and the central role of language and literature in the creation of meaning \u00a0\u2022 Language, literature and the study of the humanities \u00a0\u00a0Unit II.

Some of the questions to be dealt with are:\u00a0\u2666 What is the nature of human language?\u00a0\u2666 What is linguistics?\u00a0\u2666 What is the difference between language learning and linguistics?\u00a0\u2666 How can we analyze the structure of English as a system of communication?\u00a0\u2666 What is the role of English in different domains in our society (e.g. in school, at home, on the Internet)?", "required_readings": "Yule, G.

Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind. In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children\u2019s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing. Key questions this course explores:\u2022 How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?\u2022 What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues?

The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards \u2018standard\u2019 language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored.

Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to \u2018ownership\u2019 of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law).

Given that\u00a0discourse analysis is concerned with the systematic and careful examination of a variety of texts, this course will be\u00a0organized according to the various ways linguists may interpret the notion of text.\u00a0This semester, we begin with a general review of discourse analysis as a field of linguistic study. Then, we follow that\u00a0discussion with an overview of various rhetorical and linguistic approaches to the analysis of texts as written discourse,\u00a0examining non-fiction (essays) and literary texts. Our stylistic analyses of writing includes the study of rhetorical aspects\u00a0(aims, purpose, rhetorical situation, style, discourse blocs, modes of development, voice/persona, tone, attitude, and\u00a0readability) and syntactic matters (i.e., lexical, phrasal, and clausal use). With an understanding of this approach, we use it to\u00a0analyze student-written essays; in addition, we consider what our findings may suggest about the texts and their writers,\u00a0with a view to identifying strategies for possible rewriting and revising.\u00a0Moving from text as written discourse, we adopt a broad notion of the term text as both written and spoken discourse. Primarily\u00a0using the work of text-linguists, we consider structures \u201cbeyond the sentence.\u201d That is, we now view the idea of a text as\u00a0any passage, either spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole; and we consider what makes a text\u00a0\u201cgood\u201d or \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of information flow (the way ideas are dispersed throughout a text) , coherence (global\u00a0concern that indicates a text is unified), and cohesion (local or surface concern that serve to link one idea and sentence to\u00a0the next one in a text). Again, once we complete some cohesion and information flow analyses, we look at practical ways\u00a0we might apply some of the key ideas in teaching and learning situations in Hong Kong.\u00a0Finally, we conclude with the notion of text as talking\u2014oral exchanges. We will analyze naturally-occurring language in use, i.e.,\u00a0conversational analysis and pragmatics. To do so, we will cover such concepts such as the Gricean maxims and the\u00a0Cooperative Principle (rules and conditions which speakers abide by in effective or \u201chappy\u201d exchanges), implicature\u00a0(indirect meaning), speech acts (social act performed by the uttering of certain words), as well as associated phenomenon\u00a0(e.g., framing, turn-taking, overlap, interruption, adjacency pairs, etc. ). Our study of text as talk will enable us to explore\u00a0how and why people \u201cdo\u201d things with words, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.\u00a0By the end of the course, we hope to have a better understanding of how discourse analysis reveals to us the intricacies of a\u00a0text as well as enhances our knowledge of how such analysis can strengthen our abilities as language users\u2014speakers and\u00a0writers.", "required_readings": "Discourse Analysis Readings.

It asks questions that only a survey of tens of thousands of texts can answer \u2013 how does the thematic concern of western literature change over the decades\u2026 or over the centuries? And not just the thematic concern of the canonical literature we all know, but all western literature (or as much of it as we can recover today!) Such questions cannot be answered by the individual scholar but, as Moretti understood, they can be answered with the aid of computation. This course introduces you to the debates provoked by Moretti\u2019s ideas and then moves on to show you how distant reading is practiced today.
