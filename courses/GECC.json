Students will form an interdisciplinary team to conduct a small group research on topics of interdisciplinary nature, current affairs, cross-disciplinary knowledge or daily life issues. With preliminary work and most of the research being carried out in the second term and the summer of the preceding academic year, students are enrolled to the course in term one, normally in the 4th year of study (Y4T1), where students will deliver an oral presentation, exchanging ideas with one another in a seminar context and submit written works.This course cultivates knowledge and skills in problem solving, critical thinking and value judgment; nurtures appropriate attitude and techniques in cross-disciplinary collaboration, rational and contributive teamwork as well as analysis with multiple perspectives.Advisory: 1. This course is intended for senior year students: a. Course registration at Term 1 of the graduation year (e.g. Y4T1),  pre-registration in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2). b. Students admitted to Senior-Year Places who will complete their undergraduate programme in 2 years should make pre-registration in Y1T2 for course registration in Y2T1. c.

Students must pre-register with the College in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2) and conduct most of the research work required in the summer.3.

Students of case 1(c) opting for taking this course later than the 4th year of attendance must notify the College GE Office before the deadline of the pre-registration period in Y3T2. To take the course in later year (e.g. Y5T1 or Y6T1), it has the same requirement of pre-registration with the College in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y4T2 or Y5T2). However, students of this category have to be aware of the teaching/clinical practice, fieldwork placement, professional examinations, etc. in their Year 5 or above when considering not following the normal schedule.", "outcome": " After taking the course, students will be able to: \u00a0 1. integrate learning from various disciplines; \u00a0 2. conduct study to address broad issues in real life beyond their major subject; \u00a0 3. address issues with basic research methodology and a liberal approach to diverse values; \u00a0 4. present arguments in both oral and written form in a logical and coherent manner; \u00a0 5. develop information literacy and foundations for lifelong learning; \u00a0 6. demonstrate active and rational collaboration in group discussion; \u00a0 7. demonstrate personal and social soft skills, and the ability to work in a team. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u4fee\u8b80\u672c\u79d1\u5f8c\uff0c\u540c\u5b78\u5c07\u80fd\u5920\uff1a \u00a0 1. \u7d9c\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5b78\u79d1\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\uff1b \u00a0 2. \u9032\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8a0e\u672c\u79d1\u4ee5\u5916\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u73fe\u5be6\u751f\u6d3b\u554f\u984c\uff1b \u00a0 3. \u904b\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u63a1\u53d6\u958b\u653e\u4e26\u63a5\u7d0d\u591a\u5143\u7684\u614b\u5ea6\u63a2\u8a0e\u554f\u984c\uff1b \u00a0 4. \u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u548c\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\uff0c\u5408\u4e4e\u908f\u8f2f\u53ca\u689d\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u767c\u8868\u8b70\u8ad6\uff1b \u00a0 5. \u767c\u5c55\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7d20\u990a\u548c\u7d42\u751f\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b \u00a0 6. \u5c55\u793a\u7a4d\u6975\u53ca\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff1b \u00a0 7. \u8868\u73fe\u500b\u4eba\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u7684\u8edf\u6280\u5de7\u548c\u5728\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u5718\u968a\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "syllabus": " Keywords\u00a0: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supervised Project \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Self-directed learning \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Problem Solving \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Idea Exchange    \u00a0  GECC4130 is a student-oriented teaching (STOT) course for senior year students.
