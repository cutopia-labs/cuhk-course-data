The innovation may be, but not limited to, a campaign, broadcast programme, social media channel, content curation, publication, documentary, workshop, f2f or online course, symposium, product, service, experiential activity, startup, etc. The idea should be desirable, feasible and sustainable, and bring positive social impacts.Each group will formulate and present their proposal or action plan, explain their design thinking. It is not necessary to implement the whole idea out but the group is required to illustrate the expected production of their idea with a mock-up / prototype / sample / scaled-down pilot trial.The innovation has the mission of disseminating expert knowledge to non-expert audiences, serving as an interface between expert knowledge to a self-select target audience, e.g. young learners in primary school or below, secondary school students, or even the general public with no restriction to age or knowledge background. Each group will select an area of specialized knowledge for their innovation project. Here are some examples for reference: popular science, popular philosophy, popular legal knowledge, arts and humanities application, engineering and society, sports science, mental health, language and mind, education, pedagogies and technologies, sustainability, upcycling, circular economy, environment and urban planning, nature and evolution, health and medicine, psychology and behavior, successful aging, biotechnology, rare disease, genome engineering and ethics, coding and logic, artificial intelligence, voice or face recognition, cryptocurrency, block chain, ESG (Environment, Social, Governance), cultured meat, Agri-FoodTech, future vehicle (future transportation), renewable energy, FinTech, big data, statistics in life, virtual reality, digital identity, digital security, glocalization, infotainment, athleisure, eSports, EM & DM & Gen Z, new media, post-truth, 5G (5th generation mobile networks), smart city, space exploration, religion & science, life education, value education, etc. Students can choose any area freely and they are not restricted by the examples provided.Advisory:1.
