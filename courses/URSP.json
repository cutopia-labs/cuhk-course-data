This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities? As urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated. By highlighting the complex and contested dynamics of urban life, the course will help students situate and interpret their everyday urban experiences at the intersection of multiple and interconnected flows, networks, and scales that are produced by the city and that produce it.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2030", "title": "Urban Cultures", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Urban Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "Cities are dynamic sites of cultural production, interaction and transformation. Everyday experience of urban areas is characterized by specific social relations, spatial configurations and temporalities, while cities are home to various cultures emerging from multiple axes of difference. This course aims to introduce students to various ways in which urban life shapes and is shaped by cultural processes, institutions and practices. Students will learn about distinct urban senses, experiences and subjectivities only found in modern cities. We will explore how various cultural identities are (re)produced and negotiated by groups with different ethnic, religious and class backgrounds. To this end, we will look at the relationship between cultural background and inequality, segregation and domination.
