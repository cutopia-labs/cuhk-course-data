This course aims to introduce China\u2019s cultural heritages from the perspective of cultural geography. As an important sub-discipline in human geography, cultural geography examines how people use space and develop it into places \u2013 a process of cultural landscape formation. \u201cSpace\u201d here is nothing immutable or monolithic; instead, individuals, groups, civilizations and their culture \u201ccraft\u201d characteristic places through interactions with the surrounding environment and specific political and economic systems (themselves determined by culture). China provides numerous extraordinary examples to illustrate these topics. The course includes four key components: 1) the theoretical foundation: fundamentals of cultural geography; 2) the legacies and regional variations of China\u2019s cultural heritages; 3) topical issues about China\u2019s cultural heritages; 4) the cultural convergence in aspects of globalization and cultural transformation.

Broad issues regarding China\u2019s cultural heritages will be discussed to appreciate that cultural landscape formation is the result of multiple forces (e.g. natural, geographical, social, economic, political, etc) working together to form space and then places. After completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0   adopt a normative stance in evaluating the cultural landscapes;   \u00a0   identify essential features of China\u2019s cultural heritages from the lens of cultural geography;   \u00a0   understand Chinese cultural heritages\u2019 multiple dimensions and geographical variations, and how these factors shape and reinforce space, place and cultural formation;   \u00a0   discover cases or use experiences to describe and diagnose how the development of Chinese cultural heritages is associated with forces at different geographical scales such as local, regional, national and even global scales;   \u00a0   organize their ideas and information under the framework of cultural geography; and   \u00a0   explain their ideas in a communicative manner to promote Chinese culture.   \u00a0    \u00a0", "syllabus": " As shown below, the course contents will be divided into 4 parts and 12 topics. \u00a0 Part I: Fundamental of Cultural Geography: Interpreting Places and Spaces of Cultural Heritages (3 lectures): \u00a0 This component covers key theories and concepts developed over the past 30 years in cultural geography (both classical and new cultural geography approaches), and explain why cultural geography offers a very unique but important approach to study China\u2019s cultural heritages. Theoretical exploration will help bring out ideas about space, place, power, cultural landscape, and identity. How people use space and develop it into place will be discussed. Many examples will be used to help students understand the approaches of cultural geography. \u00a0 1.

Now, student will begin their journey of understanding the subject matter, with a focus on several key cultural regions in China. The aim of this component is to covey a deep sense of place as an integral system engaging multiple force, e.g. myth and legend, power and politics, history and tradition, religion and symbol, nature and geography, cultural practices, and society\u2019s interconnection with the environment. Students will make a good sense of a wide geographical variation of Chinese cultural values and practices. \u00a0 \u00a0 4.

The cultural convergence and transformation will be discussed. The focus is not simply to interpret convergence as some kind of loss of unique characteristics of our cultural tradition. Rather, we wish to stress that when one gets involved in intercultural interaction, one should be likely to become aware of and even enhance one\u2019s cultural tradition.

The characteristics of each style and genre are shaped by sociocultural, geographical, and historical contexts as well as changing definitions of what it means to be Chinese. Beginning with the notion that Chineseness and Chinese culture are changeable and malleable, this course introduces students to various forms of Chinese music performed and popularized in Chinese and Chinese-speaking communities and their relationship to the construction of Chinese identity and sociality. Students will not only learn to appreciate the nature of the ever-changing world of Chinese music but to listen to it with critical insights and to understand how it relates to its context. Rather than approaching Chinese music as fixed and unchanging tradition anchored in a lineal historical trajectory, this course will treat each genre as a unique product of its time and social ethos. Hearing music in social contexts is a dynamic and productive way to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the evolution of Chinese culture, identity, and the construction of community. The final project will be a group collaboration analyzing aspects of a genre of Chinese music found in Hong Kong.

As a cornerstone of Chinese culture, Confucianism contributes to the establishment of the human moral way by articulating a conception of humans as moral subjects. Taoism stresses the pursuit of an ideal life by understanding the changes of the universe, while Buddhism applies the concept of karma to show how the ultimate cause of human suffering lies in ignorance.

This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them \u2018Chinese\u2019. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world\u2019s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People\u2019s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be \u2018development\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018sustainability\u2019 on the other. ", "outcome": " Upon completing this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 - explain why claims about being Chinese and Chineseness can be such a source of contention. - explain why there are similarities as well as differences across different Chinese societies. - historically as well as anthropologically account for the place of contemporary China within the world-system. - critically discuss the major features and social institutions of Maoist and post-Mao China. - discuss the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), their significance in our times, and how \u2018sustainability\u2019 challenges ideas of development in general and Chinese development specifically. - critically evaluate which of the 17 SDGs are realized \u2013 or compromised by - the Chinese development experience. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Core Content \u00a0 1.

Vignettes of Maoist China\u00a0 6. The Anthropology of Post-Reform China 7. Discussing post-reform China in light of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) \u00a0 What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese? And what constitutes Chinese society? When Chinese populations elsewhere (e.g. overseas Chinese) lay claim to being Chinese, what are they invoking? On the other hand, when ethnic Chinese Hong Kongers claim that they are not Chinese, for instance, what are they implying? Is being Chinese primarily given by ethnicity, nationality, cultural/civilizational practices, some combination of the above, or all of them?  This line of questioning would suggest that when we invoke \u201cChinese culture and society\u201d, we refer not only to culture and society in China but also beyond, to Chinese societies elsewhere that have emerged as a result of the Chinese diaspora. Yet at the heart of this discussion still lies the question with which we first began: what does it mean to be Chinese? And what binds mainland Chinese societies with those overseas?  Because the shared identity of being Chinese has here been shown to transcend geographical and national boundaries, I would propose that being Chinese pertains more to the evolving practices of culture than it does the more limiting constraints of ethnicity, geography, or nationality. This class therefore examines the constituents of being Chinese, with the emphasis placed on culture as its animating force.  Accordingly, we begin the course by underlining the significance of\u00a0 \u201cculture\u201d to being \u201chuman\u201d and trace out the implications of this proposition. (Topic 1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Indeed, it is because culture is a cumulative and evolving social phenomenon \u2013 a process - that accounts for the diversity of Chinese societies around the world (e.g. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), that there is something identifiably Chinese in each of them, yet something else that differentiates between them. A pluralist cultural view\u00a0\u00a0 of \u201cChinese\u201d - a civilizational view (?) - will thus be taken as we tease out the similarities and differences existing across these societies. (Topics 2 and 3).  After discussing the differences between the Chinese societies of the world, we will turn our attention to examining the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), whose breathtaking economic development over the past forty years is not in question. Because China - and the PRC, specifically - is a political entity that has had a history of antagonistic relations with the West, the course approaches discussion of China by first problematizing it as a political and historical entity, including its Maoist-Socialist past. (Topics 4 and 5). Such historic contextualization of China is felt to be necessary, the pre-requisite for any discussion of contemporary China, not least its post-Mao developments.  This brings us to the many aspects of post-Mao and post-reform China, the last forty years that have come to be associated with China\u2019s famed developmental experience. (Topic 6).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The consequences of Chinese development - especially in the post-Mao era - speak to most, if not all, of the SDGs, which can be understood to refer to sustainability in three realms: economic, social and ecological. Hence, the anthropology of post-reform China (6) will necessarily highlight issues pertaining, for instance, to poverty and hunger alleviation (SDG 1,2), health and well-being (SDG3), gender (SDG 5), inequality\u00a0 (SDG10), energy (SDG7), and urbanization (SDG 11), among others. This is conducive for a discussion about the SDGs with reference to Chinese development and an examination of whether or not, and when, they are consistent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0 Culture and Humanity Goodman, Mary Ellen. 1967. \u201cThe Nature of Culture\u201d.

The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China\u2019s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2334", "title": "China Today", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for Anthropology Majors; and students who have taken ANTH2410, UGEA2180 or 2190. \nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "China is looming large on the global scene and our everyday life. It is a rising power that is changing the world order. It is a land of promising opportunities that attract an immense amount of capital and talents from overseas. Not to mention that a large part of the stuff we consume is produced in China. However, China is still\u2014at least nominally\u2014a socialist country that continues to embrace one-party rule and political censorship. Through the holistic perspective of anthropology that gives equal emphasis on political, economic, social, cultural, and ecological factors, this course addresses a host of issues that are salient in understanding China and its position in the contemporary world. The anthropological perspective is particularly good at making sense of the macro-level issues through studying day-to-day details and processes in a small locale. This course starts with examining China's revolution-packed modern history and the making of the powerful Communist Party; topics covered include classical anthropological themes on family, kinship, religion, education, ethnicity, identity, and morality. In the second half of the semester, this course examines emerging social concerns to explore how global processes such as modernization and late-capitalist development shape Chinese cultural and social institutions. These concerns include consumerism, individualism, urbanization, underground (unofficial) culture, civil society and activism, and financialization and digitalization. The course also draws from disciplines other than anthropology\u2014for example, history\u2014and some of the finest journalist writings on China. The overall intention is to provide a well-rounded and nuanced understanding of China today. The course prepares students for the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Anthropology has a strong heritage concerning inequality, marginalized group, human and environment, and wellbeing for all. Analyzing China, this course aims at understanding the development and choices of human beings. Therefore, the course will improve students\u2019 reflection on several SDGs including \u201cpromoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth,\u201d \u201creducing inequality within and among countries,\u201d \u201csustainable consumption and production patterns,\u201d and \u201cpeaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and providing access to justice for all.\u201d ", "outcome": "  Acquire a good understanding of contemporary China.  Be acquainted with the anthropological holistic perspective.  Identify the core cultural characteristics of Chinese society and how they are shaped by political, economic, social and ecological factors.  Analyze emerging concerns in China in the context of global transitions.  Reflect upon the challenges regarding inequality, marginality, sustainability, and inclusiveness based on the analysis of China.  Establish the students\u2019 own critical perspective of China today and the world.  Evaluate the concept of sustainability and development anthropologically to figure out how to meet the challenges of SDGs.", "syllabus": " I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction \u00a0 1.
