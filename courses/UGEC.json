It discusses, through surveys, how Japanese people view their society and how they view their future. It asks students to consider which problems are seen as the most critical in their societies, how their own societies view their future, and how popular views about their societies and about their societies' future are related to the beliefs held by individuals.\u00a0Read: (Read one-quarter of letters) \"Rethinking the War Experience.\" In Frank Gibney.

This course examines the development and academic significance of various forms of Japanese popular culture such as films, comics, music, TV dramas and culinary culture, from multidisciplinary perspectives, including history, cultural anthropology, cultural studies and media studies. It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix.

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.", "syllabus": "Main Objective:This main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between Japan and Asia are by no means one-way traffic and Asia has been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\u00a0Key Issues and Problems:The following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\u00a01) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in Asia will be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary Japan. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\u00a0Core Content, Structure and Selected Topics:The course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture: (1) the application of cultural globalization theory in Japan, (2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries, (3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Accordingly, its structure follows the design of core content and contains the following three parts:\u00a0Part 1: Japanese Popular Culture and Cultural Globalization: Theories and PracticesSelected Topics:(a) Introduction to Basic Theories in Cultural Studies and Cultural Globalization(b) Globalization of Japanese Popular Culture in an Asian Context(c) Reexamining the Cultural Imperialism, Orientalism and Nihonjinron\u00a0 Discourses(d) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (1) Food and Fashion(e) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (2) TV Programs\u00a0Part 2: Interplay between Globalization and JapanesenessSelected Topics:(a) Nihonjinron in Japanese Movies and Alternative Mode of Globalization(b) The Formation of Japanese Manga and Anime and Their Hybridity(c) The Making of an Otaku Culture in Japan and Beyond(d) The Adaptation of Chinese Tradition in Japanese popular culture\u00a0Part 3: The Global Strategy of Japanese Cultural IndustriesSelected Topics:(a) Glocalization of Japanese Video Games and Cyber Culture(b) Transnational Collaboration and Cross-cultural Themes in Japanese Movies(c) Japaneseness and Universality in Japanese Comics and Animated Series(d) Exporting and Domesticating Japanese Formula in Asian Drama and Music(e) Media-mix as a Business Strategy in Japanese Cultural Industries\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Koichi Iwabuchi, Recentering Globalization: Popular Culture and Japanese Transnationalism (Duke UP, 2002), chapters 1-3, 5.2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D.

Moreover, students will be able to understand the usage of the language, different styles and when each should be used, and different strategies used in expressing politeness.\u00a02. Students are expected to understand the relationship between the language expressions and the behaviors of Japanese people in various circumstances and the reasons behind such behaviors.\u00a03. Through comparing the culture of Japan with that of Hong Kong, students will become able to make comments on the characteristics of each and distinguish between the two.\u00a04. Students will be able to perform an elementary study regarding Japanese culture and this will help the students to develop his/her further study in Japanese Studies.\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "Week 1\u00a0Lesson 1\u00a0Introduction to Japanese culture:\u00a0This lesson explains how Japanese culture influences daily life in Hong Kong today. The usage and the characteristics of Japanese language will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2\u00a0Lesson 2\u00a0Introduction to the historical changes of kanji and kana in the Japanese language:\u00a0This lesson explains the historical changes of kanji and kana in Japanese language. Focus will be on why Japanese absorbed Chinese characters into their writing system and the process of how Chinese characters were converted to the modern kana (hiragana and katakana).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3 \u2013 Week 4\u00a0Lesson 3\u00a0Introduction to the phrases expressing linguistic politeness:\u00a0This lesson briefly explains the phrases expressing linguistic politeness. These include honorific expressions, expressions used in making requests, making apologies, expressing gratitude and personal opinions, giving advice and asking for permission. Emphasis will be placed on when and how these expressions are used. The relationship between such expressions and the characteristics of hierarchy in Japanese society will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4 - 5\u00a0Lesson 4\u00a0Strategies used in making requests and refusals in Japanese: \u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese make requests and refuse the requests of others. Such expressions are often used in daily life by Japanese but are not easily understood by foreigners. Special attention will be given to: \u00a0a. the difference in behaviour between Japanese and non Japanese in making requests and refusals.\u00a0b. how this behaviour reflects characteristics of Japanese culture. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6 \u2013 Week 7\u00a0Lesson 5\u00a0Strategies used in making apologies and taking responsibility:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese apologize and take responsibility after misconduct such as scandals or accidents. For example, we often see the top management of Japanese companies bow to the public to apologize for their misconduct and they may even quit the company in order to take responsibility for problems. In Hong Kong, it is rare to see such a phenomenon. We will discuss the mechanism of how Japanese make an apology and the effect of the Japanese way of apologizing upon social situations. Special attention will be given to the comparison of the styles of apology in Japanese and Hong Kong societies. We will also discuss the relationship between the Japanese way of apologizing and issues related to the Sino-Japanese War.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 8 \u2013 Week 9\u00a0Lesson 6\u00a0Ambiguity in the Javanese language:\u00a0Compared with other languages such as Chinese, there are many ambiguous linguistic practices in Japanese. These include, for example, the deletion of the subject \"watashi\" (I), the use of \"koto ni\u00a0narimashita\" (become something) rather than \"koto ni shimashita\" (I decided to do something) when talking about personal matters such as getting married, and the frequent use of intransitive verbs rather than transitive verbs. Most Japanese language learners including Hong Kong learners have experienced difficulties with these expressions and practices in their learning process. We will analyze and comment on this phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9 \u2013 Week 10\u00a0Lesson 7\u00a0The Business Manner of Japanese:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese behave in business negotiations. Japanese are often criticized for not stating their true feelings and opinions. They often use expressions such as \"kangaesasetekudasai\" (Please let me think about it), \"kekkoo desu\" (It's O.K. /No, thank you) to indirectly express their opinions. We will discuss why Japanese behave in such a way and the correct way to deal with a Japanese business partner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10 - Week 11 \u00a0Lesson 8\u00a0Japanese language in a sociolinguistic perspective:\u00a0In this lesson we discuss the following items of importance in sociolinguistics as they appear in the Japanese language.\u00a0a. the comparison between written and colloquial styles\u00a0b. the comparison of language usage for men and women\u00a0c. the comparison between the standard language and dialect\u00a0d. the comparison of language usage between the young and the elderly\u00a0e. the comparison between formal styles and informal styles\u00a0f. the comparison between jargon and standard expressions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12\u00a0Lesson 9\u00a0The success and failure in learning Javanese language (with a focus on Hong Kong Cantonese speaking learners):\u00a0First, we will give a brief introduction to the theories of second language acquisition. Next, the factors affecting the results of the process of second language learning will be discussed. To ensure a better understanding, case studies comparing English language acquisition among Japanese and Hong Kong people will be introduced. Finally, by summarizing the above observations and the characteristics of both Japanese and Cantonese, we will comment on the difficulties experienced by Hong Kong Cantonese speaking Japanese learners.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13\u00a0Lesson 10\u00a0Special topics on Japanese 1anguage and Japanese culture: \u00a0Special topics will be selected to help students understand the relationship between Japanese language and culture.\u00a0a. \"shin go ryuukoogo taishoo\" (New words and buzz terms Grand Prix)\u00a0b. \"kotoshi no kanji\" (The Chinese character of this year)\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Lesson 1\u00a0Introduction to Japanese culture:\u00a01 Gottlieb, Nanette.

These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour. \u00a0 Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach. Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong. The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.", "syllabus": "Teaching Plan and Readings (* required readings)\u00a0\u00a0Part I.

The core content includes: Module 1: What is Drug? Chapter 1&2 Introduction to Drugs The first two chapters discuss the physiological and psychological effects of mind-altering substances and their use from \u201ctraditional\u201d societies to modern societies. Module 2: Drug Effects Chapter 3&4 Addictive Drugs: Alcohol and Heroin These two chapters introduce two highly addictive drugs, namely alcohol and heroin. We discuss their cultural consumption and harmful effects and how institutional mechanisms in different societies regulate these drugs. Chapter 5&6 Psychoactive Drugs: Marijuana and LSD These two chapters discuss the controversy over drug legalization, particularly marijuana and LSD. We discuss the effects of these drugs and whether their medical and/or recreational use should be legalized. Module 3: Drug Prevention and Treatment Chapter 7&8 Drug Scene in Hong Kong and China These two chapters discuss the changing drug use patterns in Hong Kong and China and examine how these changes are interweaved with an array of social factors, such as migration and economic development. Chapter 9&10 The War on Drugs vs. Harm Reduction These two chapters introduce the common two approaches to handling drug use issues in a society: zero tolerance and harm reduction. We discuss the effectiveness of these two approaches. Chapter 11&12 Health Consequences of Drug Taking These two chapters discuss the associated risks of drug taking, including HIV/AIDS and HCV contraction. We also discuss the effectiveness of the treatment of these drug-related diseases. Various topics in relation to drugs and culture, such as cocaine use, club drug use, ketamine use, misuse of prescription drugs, and use of new pharmaceutical products, such as Prozac and Viagra, are the selected topics for this course.\u00a0", "required_readings": "\u00a0 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction to Drugs\u00a0\u00a0 Singer, Merrill. 2006. \u201cThe Colonial Era to Drug Criminalization.\u201d In Something Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health, pp.35-54.

Secondly, the Covid-19 pandemic has substantively revived global interests in urban walks, the second aim of the course is to examine the latest ideas concerning rediscovering the city through different modes of walks. Thirdly, students will learn connecting theories to practices, they will learn to become active \u201cusers\u201d of the city and adopt different forms to create new walking experiences and articulate urban experiences.More specifically, the course will focus on how \u2018walking in the city\u2019 has become an activity in its own right, and the cultural and social potentials of \u2018non-functional\u2019 urban walks. Wandering in the city has its own evolving knowledge and practices, the academic discussion accumulated through the years will be introduced. As such, through urban walks one can encounter the heterogeneity and complexity of cities including but not limited to its built environment, symbolic dimension, flows, natural elements and publicness. The heterogeneity and complexity of the city will be primarily addressed, especially through various schools of thought which have influenced how urban walks have been undertaken. The Sustainable Development Goal 3 \u2018Good-Health and Wellbeing\u2019 & Goal 11 \u2018Sustainable Cities and Communities\u2019 will be covered by the course, as urban walks have been seen as key to achieving wellbeing in recent years and it is also a means for the community to enhance their bonding by sharing local knowledge through walks.

In the first week, the introduction aims at demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of the issue and the many dimensions of urban walk as an issue. \u00a0 Week 2 The idea of walking and conceptualizing urban walks   Before discussing urban walk specifically, in week 2 the literature on walking as a human behavior will be outlined, some of the key and foundational texts will be discussed.  The early attempts to conceptualize urban walks in the 19th century will also be introduced, in particular, the idea of the Flaneur and Charles Baudelaire\u2019s contribution will be outlined. The discussion on Flaneur will be followed by interventions made by the Surrealist, Walter Benjamin and others in the first half of second century. \u00a0 Week 3 Innovating urban walks in the 20th Century  Postwar interventions such as the Situationist International and Guy Debord\u2019s thoughts on creative urban walks will be introduced, together with other modern artists and architectural theorists\u2019 initial detour into the realm of experimental walks. The discussion will be put in contrast with Jane Jacobs\u2019 ideas with more focus on urban planning and community. \u00a0 Week 4 A Japanese school of walk: Modernology and \u2018Street Observations Studies\u2019  While week 3 and week 4 largely focus on Anglo-European ideas, the substantial contribution made by Japanese artists and urban theorists will be introduced. In this week, students will practice \u2018street observation\u2019 on campus, as the initial attempt to put theory into practice. \u00a0 Week 5 Walkscapes: Contemporary art and the aesthetical turn  More artistic attempts to reinvent the practice of urban walks will be introduced in this week, in the lecture the ideas from performance studies will also be discussed to support the debates on aesthetical dimension of urban walks. Week 6 Walkability, well-being and the body  Functional dimensions of urban walks and policy related concerns will be discussed in this lecture. The lecture will also briefly introduce ideas about corporeal geography and non-representational theory, as the theoretical discussion will bring up the non-cognitive aspects of walk. (Addressing SDG goal 3) \u00a0 Week 7 Field trip 1: Walks about capturing urban experiences and experimental walks  The field trip will be about more \u2018conventional\u2019 approach to urban walk as an aesthetic practice, it will be about how heterogeneous urban experiences and observations could be gained. (Addressing SDG goal 4) \u00a0 Week 8 Heterogeneous urban experiences: Sensory and visual  The lecture will focus on the types of sensory and visual data could be gained from urban walks, the literature analyzing and conceptualizing these data and experiences will be outlined. \u00a0 Week 9 Cataloguing and expressing urban experiences: The idea of forms  The lecture will focus on how various forms are employed to catalogue and reorganize the urban experiences gained from urban walks. The forms include moving images, still images, literary experimentation, and research projects. \u00a0 Week 10 Field trip 2: Walk design and the idea of journey design  The field trip will be a practical guidance discussing how various forms of walks, guided tours and journey are designed and created. It will be followed by a more conceptual discussion on the experience economy and experiential cultural consumption. (Addressing SDG goal 11) \u00a0 Week 11 Walking in Hong Kong  The lecture will explore how the idea of urban walk has been picked up and discussed in the context of Hong Kong. The initial idea of Hong Kong as a \u2018City of Walk\u2019 will be discussed. (Addressing SDG goal 11) \u00a0 Week 12 Workshop: Presenting a walk design project (1)  The workshop will be an interactive session for students to showcase their creative \u2018walk-design\u2019 projects, the lecturer will give substantial feedback and moderate dialogues in order to foster imagination and creativity for creating potential cultural projects concerning urban walk and urban experiences (Addressing SDG goal 4) \u00a0 Week 13 Workshop: Presenting a walk design project (2) & Conclusion  The workshop will be an interactive session for students to showcase their creative \u2018walk-design\u2019 projects, the lecturer will give substantial feedback and moderate dialogues in order to foster imagination and creativity for creating potential cultural projects concerning urban walk and urban experiences  The conclusion will point to recent discussion on the future role of urban walks and cities that empower the community (Addressing SDG goal 4)", "required_readings": " Week 1 Introduction: The renewed interests in urban walks Nicholson, G.

This is reflected in its wide diversity of buildings and monuments; including ancient temples, walled villages, and legacies of its colonial period including Tai Kwun, Heritage 1881, and more recent glass and steel structures such as Norman Foster\u2019s HSBC Building. Hong Kong also has many museums and galleries containing important representations of Chinese and other cultures which were important in the development of modern Hong Kong.

It introduces key concepts, trends, and the factors driving urbanization worldwide, providing a global context for the more detailed regional studies that follow. \u00a0 1. World urban development \u4e16\u754c\u57ce\u5e02\u767c\u5c55 \u00a0 Part II: Europe (3 lectures) The European segment consists of three lectures. The first lecture focuses on the development of European cities from ancient times to modernity, highlighting the impacts of technological, social, and economic development on the evolution of urban landscapes and patterns. The second lecture takes students on a journey to explore distinctive cities across Europe, examining the unique characteristics that define them. In particular, we will discuss the issue of camera surveillance in London, the refugee crisis in Paris, post-socialist development in Berlin, and superblocks and walkability in Barcelona. The final lecture in this section shifts focus to Russia, discussing both historical and contemporary aspects of Russian urban development, and offering insights into the evolution of its cities amidst political and social changes. Students will learn about the unique urban landscape of Russian cities inherited from their imperial and Soviet histories and discuss issues such as the environmental crisis of Norilsk and the problem of street children in post-Soviet cities. \u00a0 2. Historical perspectives on urban development in Europe \u6b50\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5bdf 3.

It is a complex story of white colonization by European powers, spanning centuries and continents. Classical music has its own colonial baggage, too, with links to slavery profits and other problematic phenomena, whether in the gendered tradition of the \u201cgreat composers,\u201d or in a thriving piano industry of the early 20th century, which resulted in forced labor and countless deaths in the colonial ivory trade, or in the transnational circulation of opera in and beyond the 19th century, which would not have been possible without the port city networks of rapidly expanding empires. Importantly, such legacies have led to new forms of advocacy aimed at decolonizing classical music today. This SDG-GE course will examine how current practices around the world, on the back of complex and violent histories, attempt to democratize classical music in lockstep with the needs and concerns of contemporary society. What does it mean to decolonize musically in the 21st century, recenter marginalized individuals and groups in classical music, and make classical music more sustainable and reflective of a fair society? These questions run through the three themed sections of the syllabus: i) gender and representation, ii) equality, diversity, inclusion, iii) institutions and justice. We will explore related ideas and concepts, in connection with past contexts and present practices, including orchestras, opera companies, community projects, and social enterprises. By drawing on a variety of perspectives, we will discuss how and why decolonizing classical music matters, to whom, along with its ongoing challenges for improving and enhancing equity.  This course engages directly with SDGs 5, 10, and 16. Through the three themed sections, we will assess how classical music practices today can be observed to respond to the identified SDGs, particularly in terms of further empowering indigenous women musicians, reducing age-old inequalities, and promoting greater social justice from within institutions that can better reflect the untold tales and human experiences of classical music.

It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s.

Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement where could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. Those human settlements which develop an integrated and sustainable approach to the environmental, economic and social challenges will have more chance to grow and prosper.Ideal living environment is closely related with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG11 and SDG13 with topics covered in this course. Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) directly address the need for safe, inclusive, and resilient living environments. It includes targets for affordable housing, sustainable urban planning, and access to green and public spaces, resilient building. Climate Action (SDG 13) mitigates climate change impacts through sustainable practices which helps protect living environments from extreme weather events and environmental degradation. By focusing on these related SDGs, students can create their ideal living environments by promoting sustainability, enhancing quality of life and addressing climate change challenges that not only meet the needs of current communities that are inclusive, resilient and environmentally friendly, but also ensure sustainability for future generations.This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from the perspective of a geographer. Key themes include searching for the best location, the rise of city, forms of human settlement, ideal living and quality of life. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. Ecological civilisation, landscape cities and sustainable development of ideal living environment will also be explored. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of Hong Kong, mainland China, and other parts of the world will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructor can guide students to analyse the cases and issues through discussions.", "outcome": " After taking this course, students are expected to:  be aware of the environmental variations around the world;  be critical in the pursuit of better, if not ideal, environment for living;  be familiar with the development of city and the process of urbanisation;  develop sustainable urban planning and climate resilience strategies;  appreciate the beauty and aesthetics of various human settlement forms; and  realise that man must best use his environment and natural resource in a sustainable manner", "syllabus": " This course portraits an image of ideal living environment from a geographical perspective.

The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular.", "outcome": " Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, including lectures, video shows, forum and group discussion on current issues, the student will be able to:  acquire basic knowledge of the physical, environmental and cultural geography of the African continent  embark on intellectual dialogues and critically analyze the theoretical and practical aspects of the people\u2019s relationship with the African physical environment.  students will understand the extent to which SDGs are integrated into the African development agenda  comment academically on issues, problems and challenges related to Africa.  demonstrate a greater understanding of Africa as a continent and its people;  think critically and academically in approaching the discussions on African issues  acquire the skills and capacity to provide necessary leadership and expertise to others seeking knowledge of and involvement in Africa and African affairs.", "syllabus": " 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From MDGs to SDGs: What\u2019s in it for Africa? 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: Overview of Africa-the Place, People and Culture 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABCDE (African biodiversity conservation, degradation and extinction on Landscapes) (SDG 14 Life on Land) 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rural and Urban development in Africa (SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities) 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disasters, poverty and livelihood (SDG1 No Poverty/SDG2 Zero Hunger) 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People-land relations (SDG2 Zero Hunger/SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation) 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People \u2013 people relationship: the Role of religion (Islam and Christianity) (SDG5 Gender Equality/SDG16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institution) 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (I)(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (II) )(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 10.\u00a0 \u00a0 Africa\u2019s Emerging economy (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals) 11.\u00a0 \u00a0 China and Africa: Historical ties and contemporary issues (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals)\u00a0", "required_readings": " PART 1-\u00a0Physical and environmental aspects of African continent Alan de Brauw, Valerie Mueller, Hak Lim Lee (2014).

The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course. Different cities will be chosen as case studies for understanding various urban challenges and solutions. Apart from lectures, students will develop critical thinking on various urban challenges that affect their daily lives through video discussion, group projects and presentation in the discussion forums.", "outcome": " This course will offer students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges. As the course focuses on urban issues from global, regional and local perspectives, students will not only gain basic knowledge of the urban development process, but also learn how urban problems arise.

Culture is in the air that we breathe and it is inevitable that people construct reality through their own 'cultural lens'. However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures.

The course introduces the concept of human carrying capacity in the globe. The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources \u2013\u2013the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered.

Drawing from selected international museum collections, we will unpack a variety of institutional and geopolitical contexts that contributed to the formation of global contemporary art. \u00a0  Feminism This session will be devoted to feminist criticisms in art history, specifically the dialogues between women\u2019s art and feminist movements between the 1970s and post 2000s. We will draw from several group exhibitions in Asia and the Americas post-1989 to discuss the issues of essentialism and representation in feminist Art histories. \u00a0  Queerness This session introduces various artistic approaches in deconstructing queer identities and bodies, mainly through selected case studies in digital and performance art. Students will be encouraged to compare these with discourses introduced during the last session, and discuss ways of decentering and expanding conventional feminist discourses. \u00a0  Migration In this session, we will examine the concepts of mapping and displacements in the context of specific political and environmental crises. To do so, selections of contemporary gallery films by minority or immigrant artists will be screened, followed by a discussion. \u00a0  Transculturality and Border Art Drawing from transcultural studies and border studies, we will examine several media and performance art works as well as curatorial approaches that cope with cultural conflicts and hybridity. Selected case studies include\u00a0Magiciens de la terre in Paris in 1989, the Whitney Biennale in New York, Asian Biennale in Taichung, and documenta Kassel.\u00a0 \u00a0  Colonialism This session focuses on visual art creations that address natural resource extraction and indigenous rights issues. It will start with an introduction to primitivism in modern art, then move on to reactions to Imperialism in works by South-East Asian and African artists as new nation states and identities emerge. \u00a0  Indigenous Art and Postcolonialism We will talk about First Nations land justice and reconciliation in this session. An institutional history of indigenous art will be covered first, then selected contemporary practices and their cultural representations under specific government policies. Particular attention will be given to discourses in Canada, Australia, and the New Zealand. \u00a0  Environmentalism This session introduces discourses of eco-art and the Anthropocene. We will also draw from political ecology to discuss artistic approaches to environmental justice. Issues of community engagement and green washing will be attended. \u00a0  Bio Art This session provides an overview on the history of bio art, its application in industries, the public reception, and the ethical issues. \u00a0  Digital Capitalism In this session, we will look at artistic reflections on surveillance and digital capitalism through concrete examples. We will screen selected essay films that engages with data discrimination, surveillance infrastructure, and deepfake, followed by a discussion. \u00a0  Asian Diaspora In this session, we will discuss the definitions of diaspora and the Sinophone through visual arts. We will look at artists outside of Mainland China who engage with \u201cChinese\u201d identities differently. Works by such artists as Ian Cheng, Patty Chang, Musquiqui Chihying, and Lee Wen will be discussed. \u00a0", "required_readings": "  Introduction: Autonomy Fraser, Andrea. \u201cAutonomy and Its Contradictions.\u201d open!

By examining family life, social class, mental health, public performances of happiness, and digital interactions, students will gain insight into how emotions are constructed, expressed, and managed in various contexts. Through case studies, personal narratives, and ethnographic accounts, students will critically analyze how emotions like happiness, shame, bitterness, and depression intersect with broader social expectations and transformations.

This lecture will introduce the concept of emotion as well as its relevant concepts feeling and affect, and their relevance in the socio-political context of contemporary China. It will explore how emotions are both a result of and a response to China's rapid transformations over the decades. Week 2: Emotions in Transition: A Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective on Emotional Experiences in China  This lecture will examine the historical evolution of various emotions in China and explore how the same emotions may be understood and experienced both similarly and differently across other societies. \u00a0Week 3: Caregiving and the Politics of Paternalistic Emotions  This lecture will explore the emotional labor of caregiving in China, particularly how family caregivers navigate affective expectations and the paternalistic nature of state-society relations.\u00a0 Week 4: \u201cWhy Family Hurts?\u201d: The Moral Dimensions of Emotions at Home  This lecture will explore the emotional complexities within Chinese family life, focusing on how familial relationships can become sources of both emotional support and emotional pain. It will highlight the tension between personal emotional needs and the moral imperatives of familial duty, exploring why emotions in the family context can be particularly fraught. Week 5: Bitterness and Endurance: Narrating Pain from Lives on the Margins  This lecture will explore the emotional experiences of rural migrants in urban China, focusing on the emotions of bitterness and endurance. It will examine how migrants navigate the emotional burdens of displacement, economic marginalization, and social exclusion, often unable to fully articulate their emotional suffering.\u00a0 Week 6: Class, Modernity, and Emotional Reflexivity  This lecture will examine how emotions like shame and pride intersect with social class in contemporary China. It will explore the role of personal growth groups (e.g., self-help, therapy) in constructing new emotional norms for different social classes. Week 7: Self-Development and the Emotional Economy of Purpose  This lecture will delve into the fluctuating emotions encountered in paths of self-development in China, focusing on the search for purpose and how feelings of deflation or emotional burnout are managed. Week 8: Performing Social Expectations and the \u201cGood Life\u201d  This lecture will examine how happiness in contemporary China is often intertwined with the performance of social expectations using examples such as food and weddings. Both food and weddings illustrate how happiness in China is deeply connected to societal expectations, where individuals navigate the emotional pressures of aligning personal fulfillment with collective standards of success and well-being. \u00a0Week 9: Well-being in China's Mental Health Boom  This lecture will explore the rise of mental health services in China, known as the \"psy-boom,\" and how it reflects the growing societal focus on emotional well-being. It will examine the pathologization of emotions such as anxiety and depression, and how mental health interventions are reshaping perceptions of well-being in contemporary China.\u00a0 Week 10: Understanding Depression in China: Cultural Contexts the Ethnography of Emotional Stress  This lecture will explore the complexities of understanding depression in China. It will focus on how depressive experiences in China are shaped by cultural, social, and historical factors. Students will critically engage with how these depressive experiences differ from Western biomedical models of mental health and why these cultural differences matter for diagnosis, treatment, and public health policies.\u00a0 Week 11: Digital Emotions: Social Media, Online Communities, and Emotional Expression in China  This lecture will explore how digital platforms shape emotional expression and community-building in contemporary China. We will examine how social media provides outlets for emotions often suppressed offline and fosters online communities around shared experiences, such as mental health. The lecture will also address the emotional impact of digital surveillance and censorship, highlighting the evolving relationship between technology, emotion, and social control. Week 12: Indifference, Silence, the Politics of Voice in China  Drawing on examples from everyday life, as well as state-citizen relations, the lecture will explore how emotions such as indifference and strategies of silence are used as coping mechanisms or forms of soft resistance. Week 13: Course Wrap-up: Reflecting on Emotional Landscapes in China and Personal Reflections  This final lecture will revisit the diverse emotional landscapes explored throughout the course\u2014ranging from family dynamics and social expectations to mental health and political silence\u2014and discuss how these affect both individual well-being and collective identity. This last section will also encourage students to engage in personal reflexivity, considering how their own cultural backgrounds and emotional frameworks influence their understanding of the material.\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " 1.

This course talks about the characteristics and functioning of news, and its important role and functions in society.

To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual\u2019s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society.

The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\u00a0The following is an outline of this course:\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\u00a0Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0 What is News: Characteristics and PerspectivesNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\u00a0Key concepts: definitions of news, the three \u201cIs\u201d of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0 Cultivating Good News Reading HabitsNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\u00a0Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and EliteNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\u00a0Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0 Political News: Monitoring Those in PowerNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\u00a0Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\" Some people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\u00a0Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0 International News: Our Window on the WorldThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\u00a0Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0 Free Newspapers: The New Model That WorksTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\u00a0Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet AgeGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But onlineDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\u00a0Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format\u00a0Week 10 Social Network Media as News ChannelsIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\u00a0Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching\u00a0Week 11\u00a0News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?News and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship \u00a0Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the PressJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\u00a0Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model\u00a0Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and AlternativesThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism ", "required_readings": "Required readings:Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyWerner, W., & Nixon, K.

We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads. \u00a0 Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered? Communication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices. \u00a0 Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected? What media are not \u201csocial media\u201d? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media. \u00a0 Week 5 Dating apps and romance  The meanings of \u2018romance\u2019 and \u2018intimacy\u2019 have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying \u2018love\u2019. \u00a0 Week 6 MOOC and learning  Massive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 7 KOL and public opinions Key Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in \u2018public opinions\u2019 or \u2018public sentiments\u2019.\u3000In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment  In this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products. \u00a0 Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture Comment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at \u2018likes\u2019, we focus on the mechanisms behind \u2018dislikes\u2019 and the behaviors of \u2018haters\u2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements Internet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society  The classic \u2018big brother\u2019 thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of \u2018sensor society\u2019 will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 13 Hello future!  In this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future. \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1 Phenomena, problems and issues \u00a0 Jenkins, H.

This course studies the conditions for producing a particular set of media representation and how it perpetuates the current power structure. How the progressive ideas of sex and violence can enter the social realm of discussion through media representation will also be studied.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course explores media representation as a powerful tool in perpetuating certain social reality in the following aspects: (1) it is additive to existing cultural values; (2) it supplements face-to-fact communication; and (3) the representation is monopolized (one-sided). The course also aims to sharpen students' sensitivity to the social reality that media representation of sex and violence as a commercial product is largely an outcome of the reliance of media organizations on advertising money as the funding source. In other words, the imperative of such media representation (a commercial product) is rooted in the particular socio-economic structures of commercial media organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The notion of \"power\" will also be studied in the following aspects: (1) it shapes our understanding of gender roles and \"just\" use of violence; (2) media organization is structurally more resourceful than the audience; (3) media representation of sex and violence is carefully constructed to appear as the \"normal\"/\"natural\"; and (4) the constructive nature of media representation is hidden.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topics (subject to change by the instructor)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction and getting to know each other\u00a0Media and Society\u00a0What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Anything wrong with newspapers?\u00a0Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Violence at a distance\u00a0Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Sex Industry 11-Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Course Pack Materials:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1:\u00a0Read: \"Sex and Violence Don't Sell\"\u00a0Read: \"Yellow Journalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Media and Society\u00a0Read: \"Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action\"\u00a0Read: \"True Crime: The Origins of Modem Sensationalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Read: \"Advertising: The magic system\"\u00a0Read: \"Handling Sex\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Anything wrong with our newspapers?\u00a0Read: \"Modern Communication: Enlargement and Animation\"\u00a0Read: \"Social Production of News\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 5: Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Read: \"Racism and the Aesthetic of Hyperreal Violence\"\u00a0Read: \"Aestheticization of violence\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6: Violence at a distance\u00a0Read: \"Regarding the pain of others\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9: Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Read: \"Self-employment and 'Professionalism\"'\u00a0Read: \"Sex Worker\"\u00a0Read: \"Multiple Stigma, Discrimination and Violence\"\u00a0www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/TorontoPosters/instigmamsmfsw.pdf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10: Sex Industry 11\u2500Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Read: \"Pornography and Male Supremacy7'\u00a0Read: \"Misguided, Dangerous and Wrong: An Analysis of Anti-pornography politics\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 11: Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Read: \"Beauty is the Beast\"\u00a0Read: \"Looking good: The psychology and Biology of Beauty\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12: Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Read: \"Masculinity\"\u00a0Read: \"Constructing Perfect Women\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13: Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Read: \"Preface to the Fourth Edition, 1891\u00a0Read: \"Intimacy Transformed?\"\u00a0Read: \"The mating game\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 14: Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0Read: \"Sports, Media and Stereotypes\"\u00a0Read: www.batteredmen.com\u00a0Read: \"Battered Men?

With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises.

Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies. Key concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts \u00a0 Week 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations \u00a0 The class teaches Freeman (1984)\u2019s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt\u2019s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases. Key concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 3 The public, the media and the new media \u00a0 The class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied. Key concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media \u00a0 Week 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies. \u00a0 Blog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed. Key concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 5\u00a0 and 6 Pre-crisis planning \u00a0 The class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning. A good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed. Key concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures \u00a0 Week 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management \u00a0 Benoit\u2019s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs\u2019 (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast. Key concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news \u00a0 Week 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication \u00a0 Post-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era. Key concepts: post-crisis communication \u00a0 Week 11 Guest speaker \u00a0 An expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students. \u00a0 Week 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis \u00a0 The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.

SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Week 1: Subliminal Messaging and Materialism \u00a0 This week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 2: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites \u00a0 Social networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains? \u00a0 Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth \u00a0 The recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one\u2019s decision about how to spend his / her money. \u00a0 Week 4: Political Campaigns and Elections \u00a0 The presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election. \u00a0 II. MEDIATION OF REALITY \u00a0 Week 5: Beauty Ads and Body Image \u00a0 This lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries. \u00a0 Week 6: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles \u00a0 This lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality. \u00a0 Week 7: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education \u00a0 The educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students\u2019 mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education. \u00a0 Week 8: A \u201cCopycat\u201d Culture \u00a0 \u201cCopycat\u201d China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality. \u00a0 III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS \u00a0 Week 9: Freedom of Speech and the Press  This class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland. \u00a0 Week 10: Globalizing and Standardization \u00a0 Global brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization. \u00a0 Week 11: \u201cAnti\u201d Campaigns and Social Movements \u00a0 This lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns. \u00a0 Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns \u00a0 Greenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies. \u00a0 Week 13: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health \u00a0 World Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine \u2026 for the purpose of treating \u2026 or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state. However, some prominent direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are produced and broadcasted in Hong Kong recently. DTC drug advertising will change the traditional beliefs towards doctor-patient relationship and the demand of name-brand drugs at the expense of generic or equally effective drugs. Students will explore the Campaigns of Gardasil and Cervarix to find out their use of Government bodies as fa\u00e7ade to lure the public to consult doctors about the drugs.", "required_readings": " Tentative Reading List \u00a0 I.

This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position.

Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media.

They will develop an understanding of cultural diversity within Japan and the broad shifts associated with population aging.  Students will gain the ability to apply anthropological theory to analyze Japanese society and culture. In conjunction, students will learn to critically evaluate scholarly and media portrayals of Japan. These critical faculties will also be relevant for understanding their own or other societies in daily life as well as for future anthropological studies.  Students will develop their writing skills. In addition to conventional academic essays, students will learn to write ethnographically about a specific site. Through writing, students will gain skills in communication of their own observations and perspectives on cultural features. These skills can be used for further academic study as well as personal and professional life. \u00a0", "syllabus": "Part I: Foundations of Japanese Culture and Society\u00a0Week 1.

It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).", "outcome": " After the completion of this course, students will:  Understand and appreciate the cultural dimensions of business operations and organization in different historical, political, and social settings;  Acquire the necessary ethnographic skills to study diverse aspects of business operations and organization;  Be able to rethink and challenge the existing assumptions regarding business practices in the modern world;  Gain the analytical tools to examine issues of over-consumption, over-production, dispossession, oppression, and other relevant discontent under global capitalism;  Be able to examine critically the role SDGs could play in addressing disparities and injustices in the world;  Understand the importance of building a more inclusive, equal and diverse society. \u00a0", "syllabus": " The course is structured in three parts. Part I Culture in Business explores the cultural dimensions of workplaces and corporate management. We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. Part III Anthropology and the Business World discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business. Overall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).

The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us \u2018more\u2019 human than previous forms of cultural life.

This course covers tangible (historical structures) and intangible heritage in Hong Kong. Through fieldwork study and intangible heritage workshop, it aims to help students understand the conservation and revitalisation of Hong Kong's heritage and its substantial social role in local society. Through investigating various local examples in Hong Kong, this course further debates the importance of cultural heritage in terms of local community building and reconstruction of historical discourses. Furthermore, it investigates how various local cultural heritage sites interact and engage with their neighbouring landscape. Students are also encouraged to examine the tensions between urban development and cultural heritage conservation in Hong Kong.This course motivates the students to investigate the dynamic between cultural heritage conservation and sustainable urban development by using their local experience and exploring possible solutions to associated challenges.

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet we are faced with many challenges and controversies in our pursuit of good health: glaring inequality in health and longevity, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle, the conflicts between patients and doctors, the uncertainty of medical treatments and medical knowledge, and the ever-increasing health care spending. In this course, we dissect these issues from the perspectives of social sciences. We first assess the social determinants of health and illness and examine the following topics: the social distribution of health and illness, societal inequality and health, social networks, social capital and health, health lifestyle and public policy, and the interaction between genetics and social environment. We then address the social organization of health and health care and discuss the following topics: the social construction of health and illness, the social context of patient-doctor relationship, and the social organization of healthcare systems. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the current COVID-19 pandemic and use it to illustrate how social and cultural factors influence health and well-being. This course helps the students understand and relate to the following UN sustainable development goals: SDG#3 good health and well-being, SDG#10 reduced inequalities and peace, SDG#16 justice and strong institutions. By illuminating the social and cultural determinants of health and well-being, this course will enrich the students\u2019 understanding of what contributed to good health and well-being, of the unequal distribution of health and well-being, and of the role of social and political institutions in producing health. It also seeks to motivate the students to think about public policies and social interventions that may promote health and well-being, reduce social disparities in health and strengthen health-promoting institutions.

Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). ", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will acquire both knowledge and skills of social change that are in line with feminist consciousness. Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\u00a0Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riane Eisler and Douglas P.

Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad.

Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women\u2019s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts.

What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media.

How do we understand the notion of \u201cminority\u201d? And how does \u201cminority\u201d, look like, in cinema? This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning \u201cminority\u201d identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of \u201cminority\u201d, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct \u201cthe Other\u201d in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social \u201cminorities\u201d affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object \u201cin films cut to the measure of desire\u201d of the dominant social groups.What happens when \u201cminority\u201d artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by \u201cminority\u201d filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo.

This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion.

Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives.

This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs. Key concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations(2) The Birth of Hong Kong ManThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.Key concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma(3) New Wave Film and Colonial PoliticsThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism. Some mainstream texts will be contrasted with some new wave movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some patterns of colonial articulations and de-articulations will be illustrated by these mainstream and new wave productions.Key concepts: colonialism, marginality(4) Political Metaphors in TV and FilmThe lecture will explain the reasons why there were quite of lot of political metaphors in television and films produced in the 1990s. The relations between political censorship, social anxiety and polysemic articulations will be elaborated with significant cases.Key concepts: polysemy, metaphor, censorship(5) Nonsense and Nostalgia, Remembering and ForgettingThe lecture will explain the nature of mediated collective memories and the social functions they perform. The rise of nostalgic texts in the 1990s will be contrasted with the discourses of collective memories in the 2000s.Key concepts: nostalgia, collective memories(6) Urban Space & Postmodern City The lecture will trace the changes in urban representations in films and television from the 1980s up to recent years when discourses concerning urban developments and cultural preservations are competing for public attention.Key concepts: urban imaginations, postmodernity, space and place(7) Media Events: 1997 and 1st July The lecture will introduce the theory of \"media events\" and apply it to major turning points of Hong Kong society such as July 1st in 1997 and 2003, SARS, the Sichuan earthquake, etc. The changes of Hong Kong culture will be examined by looking into the configurations of major media events in recent years.Key concepts: media events, social movements(8) The Rise & Fall of the HK Middle Class The lecture will trace the \"middle class debate\" in the 1980s. Students will be asked to think about their own class positions and how they acquired a class-relevant lifestyle. The changes in media representations of the middle class will be analyzed to see how these representations have become more sophisticated since the 1990s.Key concepts: middle class, cultural capitals, taste(9) Post 97 Hong Kong Culture The lecture will summarize some major changes in Hong Kong cultures after 1997 and contrast these new patterns with the cultural scene before 1997, focusing on the negotiations of local and national identifications.Key concepts: re-sinicization, nationalism (10) Transborder and Transnational DesireThe lecture will tell the story of the Hong Kong/Mainland border and the cultural politics it brings to the people on both sides of the border. As cultural differentials have been lowered in recent years, the general categorizations of them and us are replaced by much more complicated transborder collaborations infused with excitements and apprehensions.Key concepts: transborder cultural politcs, border, cultural boundaries(11)\u00a0Undercover Films: the double identity of Hong Kong\u00a0Using films featuring under-covered agents, the lecture will talk about the multiple identity of Hong Kong, relating this issue to Hong Kong colonial history and the political structure of one country and two systems.Key concepts: collaborative colonialism, instrumental rationality(12) Orientalism: Hong Kong, Hollywood and BeyondThe lecture will use Hong Kong movie star Chow Yuen-fat as a case to examine the rise and changes of Hong Kong culture. The \"star-text\" of Chow will be used to illustrate the effects of Orientalism, comparing Chow's local films and those produced in Hollywood.Key concepts: orientalism, star text(13) The decline of local films and the rise of co-productionsThe lecture will document the trends of co-productions and examine the effects on the weakening of local representations and the amplifications of national imaginations.Key concepts: de-scaling, re-scaling, local scale, national scale\u00a0", "required_readings":
