Theoretical exploration will help bring out ideas about space, place, power, cultural landscape, and identity. How people use space and develop it into place will be discussed.

Sustainable development is a global vision for the future. This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to \u201cinterlink and integrate\u201d Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.", "outcome": " After successfully completing this course, the students will be able to:  Evaluate the conflicting views on the reasons for the lack of a more sustainable development;  Analyze where the solutions may lay for SDGs, and the economic, social and environmental constraints to the adoption of these solutions;  Students will be able to understand and describe cognitive, socio-economic and behavioural aspects of sustainable development, and  Comprehend the skills necessary to interpret the policies of governments and international organisations. \u00a0", "syllabus": " 1.

Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools.

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality.

It begins by examining the various theories of development that explain the differences between the \u201cAdvanced Economies\u201d and the \u201cThird World\u201d. This serves as a background for a discussion of the role that global financial and trade organisations (such as the IMF and the WTO) play in shaping, or entrenching, contemporary patterns of global inequalities. Finally, the course looks at the processes of spatial transformations and economic restructuring that are taking place between and within the \u201cAdvanced Economies\u201d and the \u201cThird World\u201d, and at the ways in which these changes affect international relations, military and diplomatic intervention, aid, migration, energy policies, and social and environmental movements.", "outcome": "After successfully completing this course, the students will be able to:\u00a0\u00a0\u2022Understand the conflicting views on the reasons for the lack of development of the Third World.\u00a0\u2022Position the various theories and approaches towards Third World development in their conceptual historic period.\u00a0\u2022Recognize the major challenges that the Third World face today and develop analytical and critical outlooks about their cultural, social and economic backgrounds.\u00a0\u2022Enhance the skills necessary to interpret the policies of governments and international organisations.", "syllabus": "Course Outline (Syllabus)\u00a0    Week  Topic   1 Introduction: Third World: What it is, where it is   2 Colonialism, Environmental determinism and Mercantilism    3 Decolonisation, the cold war, and socialist models of development    4 The theory of comparative advantage, and the problem of exporting primary products   5 Dependency theory and Import-Substitution Industrialisation    6 Third World debt    7 The IMF and structural adjustment programs   8 Poverty and credit: the World Bank and the Grameen Bank   9 WTO, trade barriers, and agricultural subsidies   10 The WTO treaties: Gats and Trips   11 Export Oriented Industrialisation and the Asian Tigers   12 The Asian Tigers: Singapore and Taiwan   13  The Transnational Corporations and Foreign Direct Investment   14 Aid and development  \u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Porter, P.W. and Sheppard, E.S.
