Theoretical exploration will help bring out ideas about space, place, power, cultural landscape, and identity. How people use space and develop it into place will be discussed. Many examples will be used to help students understand the approaches of cultural geography. \u00a0 1.

Now, student will begin their journey of understanding the subject matter, with a focus on several key cultural regions in China. The aim of this component is to covey a deep sense of place as an integral system engaging multiple force, e.g. myth and legend, power and politics, history and tradition, religion and symbol, nature and geography, cultural practices, and society\u2019s interconnection with the environment.

Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue.

Sustainable development is a global vision for the future.

The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to \u201cinterlink and integrate\u201d Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals.

This course aims at providing students with an overall view on nature conservation in general and Hong Kong in particular. It will examine the history and development of nature conservation in Hong Kong including legislation, designation and management of the protected areas. Specifically, country, marine parks and geopark are developed to protected terrestrial and marine habitats as well as the associated wildlife, and geodiversity, respectively. Threats and problems facing existing protected areas will be discussed. Nature conservation will be addressed through lectures, field trips and students\u2019 projects. It will also introduce concepts and principles of nature conservation in the local and global context, including climate change, ecosystem services, geo-conservation and the global conservation efforts such as the World Summit and Convention of Biodiversity. The course helps students look at nature conservation from the perspective of sustainable development, incorporating the environmental, social and economic dimensions of development, focusing on SDG Goals 14 and 15 in particular. Both SDGs are directly linked to nature conservation efforts, focusing on preserving natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity, which are vital for the health of our planet, ensuring sustainable fishing/forest management practices for the benefit of communities.", "outcome": " Students should be able to achieve the following at the end of the course:  Understand the situation of nature conservation in Hong Kong;  Describe and explain concepts and principles of nature conservation in local and global context;  Able to explain how protecting marine and country parks contributes to biodiversity conservation, geodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources;  Explore the process in the formation of local nature conservation policy and practices;  Understand the role of conservation policies and practices in promoting environmental sustainability and achieving the SDGs;  Appreciate and differentiate values and benefits of protected areas to the community;  Identify viable measures in conserving habitats and ecosystems in Hong Kong; and  Analyze strengths and weaknesses of various conservation measures applied in Hong Kong.", "syllabus": " Course themes Part 1.

The trip will study a range of topics related to geography and resource management, urban and regional development, and socio-environmental issues in Africa. The objectives are three-fold: (1) to broaden students\u2019 horizons and knowledge base through exposure to a different and less familiar environment outside Hong Kong; (2) to enable students to make comparative studies across different countries or regions; and (3) to provide an opportunity for students to interact with non-local scholars and students in the same discipline.

It aims to offer an integrative and broad introduction to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of geographic research. The course covers hands-on issues in planning and implementing research, such as generating research ideas and justifying research topics, using library resources, establishing theoretical framework, selecting the research design and sampling standard, conducting fieldwork, collecting data, and analysing and presenting the results. In addition, this course also discusses the principles in evaluating the quality of a research. This course is organized into three modules. The first module introduces how a research topic and its relevant questions are set up, how to use the existing literature and various geographic theories to frame a research, and how to design fieldwork and sampling schemes. The second module introduces the qualitative methods in geographical research, such as conducting fieldwork, collecting and analyzing data, writing research findings, and dealing with ethical concerns. The third module covers quantitative methods in geographical research, such as data types and sources, sampling methods, questionnaire design, non-parametric tests, and analysis of variation (ANOVA).", "outcome": "Students are expected to develop a comprehensive understanding and practical experience about conducting scientific research in geography.

Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools. Design thinking ideology is penetrated through the process of map production.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3202", "title": "Environmental Management", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Geo & Resource Mgt", "requirements": "-", "description": "This course critically examines the interrelations between human activities and the environment, analyses the nature and roots of environmental problems, evaluates the effectiveness of various environmental management options and discusses the complexities of environmental policy-making.", "outcome": "At the end of course, students are expected to have developed the necessary data gathering, analytical, problem-solving and presentation skills in managing environmental problems and are able to evaluate and appreciate other\u2019s viewpoint as well as presenting theirs.", "syllabus": "    1     1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Environmental Challenge and Policy Responses \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Nature of Environmental Degradation \u00a0 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy Considerations  \u00a0 A. \u00a0\u00a0 Dose\u2011Response Relationship and Environmental Standards  B. \u00a0\u00a0 Economic Analysis C. \u00a0\u00a0 Ethics and Distributive Considerations  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy Instruments \u00a0 A. \u00a0\u00a0 Command and Control Approach B. \u00a0\u00a0 Economic Instruments C. \u00a0\u00a0 Environmental Impact Assessment \u00a0 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Issues in Environmental Management \u00a0 A. \u00a0\u00a0 Managing Uncertainty B. \u00a0\u00a0 Siting Locally Unwanted Facilities C. \u00a0\u00a0 Conflict Management and Resolution D.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wrapping Up the Course     ", "required_readings": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Environmental\u00a0Challenge and\u00a0Policy\u00a0Responses\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mitchell, B.

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality. Students are not required to have prior exposure to the field but should be open-minded in analyzing issues from alternative perspectives.

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality. Students are not required to have prior exposure to the field but should be open-minded in analyzing issues from alternative perspectives. The course will be taught from an interdisciplinary approach according to the nature of topics.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4402", "title": "World Development", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Geo & Resource Mgt", "requirements": "", "description": "Important social, cultural, and economic differences exist among different regions. This course looks at the patterns of development that have been creating these differences, and the present-day implications. It begins by examining the various theories of development that explain the differences between the \u201cAdvanced Economies\u201d and the \u201cThird World\u201d. This serves as a background for a discussion of the role that global financial and trade organisations (such as the IMF and the WTO) play in shaping, or entrenching, contemporary patterns of global inequalities. Finally, the course looks at the processes of spatial transformations and economic restructuring that are taking place between and within the \u201cAdvanced Economies\u201d and the \u201cThird World\u201d, and at the ways in which these changes affect international relations, military and diplomatic intervention, aid, migration, energy policies, and social and environmental movements.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}]
