This course draws upon the theoretical insights and empirical evidence from the Organizational Behavior (OB) research and introduces students to the applications of psychological and behavioral approaches to designing effective human resource management (HRM) policies and practices. The course provides a systematic overview of fundamental OB concepts, theories, and applications in the context of hospitality, tourism, and real estate businesses. We will discuss a variety of topics at three levels. First, we will study how individuals differ in their personality traits, values, attitudes, emotions, perceptions, and motivations. Second, we will examine how people interact with one another and work in groups and teams. Topics range from team dynamics, group decision making, power and influence, to conflict management. Leadership theories and practices will also be discussed. Third, we will discuss how organizational-level factors such as organizational culture and change affect attitudes, behaviors, and work performances of employees. The OB concepts and theories are closely related to HRM. Through the course students will learn how to apply OB theories to improve HRM effectiveness in a variety of areas, e.g., job design and analysis, employee recruitment and selection, training and socialization, employee performance appraisal, compensation and benefits, and organizational culture formation and maintenance. Students will also learn what characteristics, behaviors, attitudes, and competencies define good leadership and how to ensure successful organizational changes through effectively motivating employees.

The success of SHTM education hinges on our ability to connect theory to practice. This is a course to enable you to develop a framework to connect theory to practice. There are two specific course objectives:1. The first objective is to show you how an academic mind shapes an executive mind. We all want to become successful executives. A successful executive is someone who has an executive mind. An executive mind makes effective and efficient decisions. In the meantime, we come to study at a leading university because we want to master the best way to learn how to learn. The best learner is someone who has an academic mind. An academic mind has a firm grasp of literature and knows how to learn from current and historic great minds from different disciplines. When we have an academic mind that can guide our executive mind, we can benefit from literature and make well informed effective and efficient decisions. In this course, we introduce to you a way to see theories through daily actions and to see the relationship between theory and practice. Whenever a practice is highly significant, it pays to go to the root of the practice and make sure that there is a sound theory behind. In the meantime, in implementation, a sound practice will ensure that there is a thorough understanding of the sound theory behind.\u00a0Theory and practice are two sides of the same coin. When you have an academic mind to distil your work experience and link it to a theoretical framework, you will become much more powerful to make good use of your experience to accelerate learning. Experience without learning is hardship. Experience with learning generates personal satisfaction and growth. Learning hinges on whether one has an academic mind, the way to develop the ability to learn how to learn. The ideal of education at SHTM is to enable us to see the implication of a theory to improving practices and also to see a theory behind proven best practices. It is only possible when we have an academic mind.2. The second objective is to show you how to nurture an academic mind, the way to develop your ability to learn how to learn. We enable you to appreciate the beauty of the process to develop a body of scientific knowledge in business and social science in the context of the hospitality and real estate industries. This will give you an orientation to appreciate the contribution to literature from various business and social science disciplines, the challenge of problems in the hospitality and real estate industries, the nature of empirical evidence, the importance of journals, books, magazines and libraries, and the meaning of academic work.
