Week 1 - 4 A series of 4 lectures on basic concepts of service learning, theories of heritage preservation, fieldwork methods, and various Chinese cultural heritage in Hong Kong and its current situation. Week 5 - 12 Students will then be divided into groups, with 4 to 6 students in each group. Each group is required to select a Chinese cultural heritage item (i.e. custom, festival, handicraft, performing arts, temple, monastery, ancestral hell etc.), OR a local Chinese community (i.e. village, market etc.) to carry out a minimum of 13 hours of fieldwork and on-site service. The aim of fieldwork and on-site service is to record or promote the selected Chinese cultural heritage. There are various forms of service such as local tour, interview, design of promotional materials, storytelling, role-play, games, etc, subject to the approval of the course instructor.

What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out?
