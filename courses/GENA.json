The course will create opportunities for students to get in touch with vulnerable groups or minority members in the city. By engaging in a variety of projects or activities such as in-depth visits and interviews, students are expected to understand the environment and difficulties their target groups have been facing. The course consists of lectures, service learning experiences, and self-reflection sessions. Key concepts such as openness, civility, and inclusivity will be discussed in class, while a core principle that no individual and group should be discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, geographic provenance, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, language, ability/disability, or socioeconomic status will be stressed as these values and principles are embraced by the University and are essential to social cohesion. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students\u2019 leadership skills and foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community. In addition, the course also emphasizes reflection on the quality of leadership that demonstrates while providing service, with the particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.There will be different sessions under this course that focus on various aspects and subjects under the general theme diversity and inclusion, for example, multicultural groups, Special Educational Needs (SEN), gender equality, etc. Through the delivery of service, the students will be equipped with skills and a positive attitude to tackle social issues through collaborating with different NGO partners, and ultimately, be able to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world settings in meaningful and impactful ways.Diversity and inclusion are crucial principles of achieving the SDG goals of \u201cGender Equality\u201d and \u201cReducing Inequality\u201d. By respecting different cultures and minimizing stereotypes and prejudices, it will promote an atmosphere conducive to \u201cGood Health and Well-being\u201d of our society, with particular concern of mental health.", "outcome": " Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 1. Engage in service learning experiences that foster diversity and inclusion in community; 2. Explore and understand issues related to diversity and inclusion and how they interact with community needs; 3. Critically reflect on service learning experiences to deepen their understanding of the role of diversity and inclusion in creating a better community; 4. Develop skills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving through engagement with diverse communities; 5. Foster sense of social responsibility and commitment to creating inclusive and\u00a0diverse\u00a0communities through service-learning; 6. Equip with knowledge and actionable strategies to promote diversity and inclusion in their future career as community leaders and advocates. \u00a0", "syllabus": " This course consists of three parts \u2013 i) lectures, ii) fieldwork and on-site service, and iii) presentation and report. Week 1 - 4 A series of 4 lectures on the basic concepts of service learning, fieldwork methods, and key principles behind diversity and inclusion will be addressed. Week 5 - 12 Students will then be divided into groups, with 4 to 6 students in each group. Each group is required to select a minority group (i.e. ethnic minority, disadvantage groups, gender, SEN etc.) to carry out a minimum of 13 hours of fieldwork and on-site service. The aim of fieldwork and on-site service is to record or promote diversity and inclusion to the community. There are various forms of service such as local tour, interview, design of promotional materials, storytelling, role-play, games, etc, subject to the approval of the course instructor. The course instructor is expected to conduct at least one session of on-site supervision for each group in order to assess students\u2019 performance and commitment while peer-evaluation is also implemented. Week 13 Each group will present their projects in the last meeting, followed by a self-reflection session.

Motivating students to supervise and join their secondary students to promote and practise STEAM concepts with primary students through organizing workshop, project learning, thematic learning, as well as designs and inventions. The STEAM concepts include basic principles and concepts in science, programming, AI, etc. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students\u2019 leadership skills, and to foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community at large. In addition, the programme also emphasizes reflection on the quality of leadership that demonstrates while providing service, with the particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.SDG goals \u201cQuality Education\u201d and \u201cPartnerships for the Goals\u201d will be achieved to strive for a better and more sustainable future for all.

The course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld. The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.

But what forms of interpersonal communication create pain, alienation, and amplify conflicts? And what forms of communication overcome fear, create trust, freedom, and fulfilling human connection? \u201cEmpowerment through Nonviolent Communication\u201d provides students with a proven toolset for managing interpersonal conflicts, called Nonviolent Communication (NVC), while preserving trust and connection. These tools can be used in nearly all areas of social life. NVC, also known as Compassionate Communication, was pioneered by clinical psychologist Marshall B. Rosenberg and further developed by decades of global practitioners. Upon completing the course, students will understand NVC theories and be able to use its various tools in their daily lives. Lectures and discussions will also address the use of NVC in the context of Hong Kong and Chinese culture more generally. Students are advised that NVC methods cannot be learned as a purely intellectual exercise: you must bring to class your heart and mind. Learning activities will involve personal sharing, role plays, and reflective journal writing. Within respectful limits, students must be willing to engage in personal self-reflection and sharing; also, students must strictly abide by a confidentiality agreement not to disclose the personal stories of others outside of class.This course supports advancement towards the Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education, Reducing Inequality, and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Equitable participation in society and education are advanced through communication without coercion and harm, which is nonviolent communication. Institutions are strengthened through nonviolent communication that promotes reform and advancement while affirming the human need for security and respect.

Student will identify their own experiences of giving and of disconnecting language. Week 3: Separating Observations from Judgments Lecture and activity focusing on the skill of making and communicating nonjudgmental observations. Week 4: Feelings and Needs Lecture and activity focusing on understanding, identifying and communicating feelings and needs, within NVC theory; the interrelation between needs, feelings and judgements; and agency relative to feelings. Week 5: Requests and Demands Lecture and activity focusing on the importance of communicating about needs; the difference between requests and demands; and what to do when interpersonal conflicts about needs cannot be resolved to mutual satisfaction. Week 6: Listening Lecture and activity focusing on the theory and practice of empathic listening. Week 7: Mourning, Celebrating, and Expressing Anger Lecture and activity focusing on accepting failures, disappointments, and pain; affirming and recognizing achievements and good fortune; and expressing anger authentically, but constructively.

How is NVC being used in contemporary professional disciplines (e.g., nursing, criminology)? Week 9: NVC and Gender and Sexuality Lecture and activity focusing on the implications of NVC for the gendered ways that boys and girls, and later men and women, are socialized to experience and manage emotions and needs; NVC as it pertains to sexual minorities will also be considered.
