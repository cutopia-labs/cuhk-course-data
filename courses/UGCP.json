", "syllabus": "I. IntroductionThe introductory lecture will articulate the objectives of this core requirement in the context of the history and mission of CUHK, as well as the challenges facing Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China and as a major international metropolis in an increasingly globalized world. It will outline the different themes and topics to be covered, and how they contribute to the overall structure of the course.\u00a0II. Understanding China: Intellectual FoundationsCulture has significant transformative power on the individual and society. It informs identity and the collective imagination. It shapes beliefs and values. In the Chinese context, the influence of Confucian, Daoist and Buddhist traditions has been deep-rooted and pervasive, finding expression in every level of Chinese society and every level of Chinese life, in ethics and religion, laws and government, education and science, art and architecture and other aspects of material culture, and shaping the ways in which people relate to each other, and how they view the world. Selected core concepts which figure prominently in the Chinese intellectual and cultural tradition will be critically examined, including the concepts of order and harmony, the junzi-ideal person, ren or benevolence and empathetic concern, li or ritual and propriety, and dao or the way. These ideas provide an entry into a world of ideas that is not only critical to understanding China but also significant to global dialogue.\u00a0III. History as Mirror: Looking at Today\u2019s China from the PastThe purpose of this part of the course is not to rehearse the history of China, but to explore the recurrent themes and conceptual underpinnings that fuel and impact the remarkable phenomenon of China rising. \u00a0We will examine five themes: (a) The grand unification of the Qin dynasty, and the central government and the standardization measures it introduced; (b) The Silk Road, consisting of a network of commercial and cultural cities leading from the ancient capitals of China through India and Central Asia all the way to the Mediterranean Coast, revealing the many-faceted and multi-levelled relations between China and the West; (c) Tang Cosmopolitanism, representing a golden age of cultural development which embraced an open-door policy, with the Chinese capital serving as a major centre of art, literature, philosophy and religion in Asia; (d) The Confucian Civil Service Examination, a three-tiered examination system administered at the local, provincial and national levels, which served for centuries as a method of recruiting civil officials, and can be said to be a model of participatory equality and meritocracy; and (e) The century of humiliation, covering the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China by Western Powers\u00a0 and Japan, from the Opium War to the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u00a0IV. China\u2019s Road to Modernisation\u00a0The multi-faceted process of modernisation and social change demands careful attention. The modernisation of China can be distinguished from that of the Western nations in its being a historical movement of national salvation and self-empowerment, and also as a historical struggle to become one of the multiple centres of the world from a position of the periphery. From the perspective of social change, the country\u2019s modernisation involved giant transformations from an agricultural civilisation to an industrial one, from a monarchy to a republic, and from the study of Confucian classics to the study of science, in a leap from \u201ctradition\u201d to \u201cmodernity\u201d. This part of the course will discuss the underlying patterns of Chinese modernisation in relation to selected historical events of late Qing and Republican China, as well as the reforms of the People\u2019s Republic of China, addressing issues such as the relationship between modernisation and Westernisation, and the possibility of different forms of modernity in the context of globalisation.\u00a0V. The Chinese Economy: Past, Present and FutureThis part of the course looks at the Chinese economy in the context of the global economy. It reviews the economic development of China from the late Qing period to the present day, comparing it to the economy of other nations and with a focus on the developments since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as well as projections for the future. The review makes reference to a wide range of economic indicators, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, employment, imports and exports, income distribution, national savings, and infrastructure investment, as well as development strategies such as the dual-circulation economic development strategy and the internationalisation of the Renminbi. The lecture will also examine indicators related to sustainable development such as literacy and educational attainments, public health, prevention of climate change, air and water quality and the eradication of extreme poverty.\u00a0VI. Science and Technology in China\u00a0In the twenty-first century, science and technology are becoming an increasingly important facet of modernization for China, driving first an industrial and then an innovation economy, with major impacts on improving livelihood and in geopolitical competition. The topics covered in this part of the course include the Four Great Inventions, mathematics and astronomy in ancient and medieval China, and the question raised by Needham on why modern science emerged in Europe but not in China. Developments since the late Ming period are discussed with reference to science brought by missionaries, and the political, social and cultural reforms from the mid-19th century onwards. A critical examination will be provided of two recent periods, which saw achievements in a few centrally directed projects starting in the 1960s, and advances across a broad front since about 1980, but showing weaknesses in some sectors.

The educational rationale for the course will be articulated. The different themes and topics to be covered, and how they contribute to the overall structure of the course, will be outlined.\u00a0Module I: Basic Concepts and ThemesThis module introduces several basic concepts and themes relevant to our understanding of the position of Hong Kong within the wider constitutional order of China. A brief historical perspective is provided on the influence of Chinese culture on the Chinese legal system, and the interlocking relationship between state capacity building, the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the One-Country-Two-Systems framework, and national security. Some issues pertaining to the intricate relationship between the National Constitution and the Hong Kong Basic Law are explored. The module ends with a note on the growing awareness in the world of security issues confronting all nations and societies, the importance of safeguarding national security, and the emergence of national security as a subfield of academic study.\u00a0Module II: China\u2019s Rise: a Bicentennial PerspectiveII-1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 State Capacity and Economic DevelopmentThe first lecture of Module II introduces the concept of \u201cstate capacity\u201d, broadly understood as the ability of the state to turn its will into action and reality, in particular the building of infrastructural capacity. It is argued that state capacity provides the pivotal foundation for economic development, and played an important role in the development of early modern economies. The concept of \u201cstate capacity\u201d helps explain the Great Divergence between the West and the rest of the world in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the difference in the developmental paths of Japan and China from the mid-19th century onwards.\u00a0II-2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Decline of Old ChinaThe second lecture of Module II analyses the decline of China during the period from the time of the Opium War to the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China from the perspective of state capacity. It is argued that the decline of China during this period, or \u201cOld China\u201d, can be attributed to its weak and eroded infrastructural capacity, as reflected in its weak coercive capacity, extractive capacity and assimilative capacity. In terms of the state\u2019s ability to maintain law and order, its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita level, and its capacity to provide for education and public health, Old China ranked below most developing nations, and showed characteristics of what may be called a \u201cfailed state\u201d. \u00a0II-3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Rise of New China and its Global ImplicationsThe third lecture of the module analyses the economic development of \u201cNew China\u201d through a review of the unprecedented state capacity of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as seen in the formulation, implementation, and execution of its nationwide policies. The successful transformation of China, the most populous nation which at one point ranked rock bottom in the world in terms of development, carries significant global implications which will be explored in the lecture.\u00a0II-4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe March of the Volunteers\u201d: The Birth of the National AnthemThe module concludes with a lecture that traces the socio-historical origins of \u201cThe March of the Volunteers\u201d to a film, its composer, and the introduction of communal singing into China, as well as its reception in the West.\u00a0Module III: One Country, Two Systems: Past and PresentIII-1. \u00a0 The Constitution of New ChinaThe first lecture of Module III introduces us to some of the salient features of the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The general concept of a unitary state is introduced, referring to a system of central and local governments, with the latter deriving the rights of local autonomy from the authorization by the central government and having the obligation to preserve and defend the unity of the country.\u00a0 The ancient Chinese constitutional wisdom in implementing \u201cone country, many systems\u201d under the rubric of a unitary state sheds light on the historical and constitutional foundation for both \u201cone country\u201d and \u201ctwo systems\u201d.\u00a0III-2.\u00a0 One Country, Two Systems: its Strategic Objectives and Core FeaturesCritical to our understanding of Hong Kong in the wider constitutional order is developing an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems (OCTS)\u201d policy.\u00a0 The second lecture of Module III introduces the historical background for China\u2019s policy toward the United Kingdom after establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949, and in China\u2019s negotiations with the British leading to the return of Hong Kong\u2019s sovereignty to China. It also discusses the key tenets of OCTS from the perspective of current-day Hong Kong. \u00a0\u00a0III-3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution of PRC, The Basic Law of HKSAR and \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201dThe third and concluding lecture of the module focuses on the Hong Kong Basic Law, which is a national law of China. About one-fifth of the 160 articles of the Hong Kong Basic Law contain the term \u201cthe central government\u201d. These articles substantiate the principle of \u201cOne Country\u201d within the text of the HK Basic Law, highlighting the pivotal importance of these articles in maintaining the wider constitutional order.\u00a0Module IV: National Security in the Wider Constitutional Order\u00a0IV-1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dimensions of National Security\u00a0The first component of Module IV covers two topics related to dimensions of national security. \u00a0IV-1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial Security: Financial Stability of Hong KongThe first topic focuses on financial stability. Factors that contribute to financial (in)stability are examined, making reference to the financial crises experienced in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as policies that will safeguard financial stability in Hong Kong. \u00a0IV-1B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information Security: The Bigger Picture-Do You Trust Your Big Data? The second topic addresses the issue of information security. The complexity of keeping data secure, guarding against misinformation and disinformation, and ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability, is highlighted with reference to Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. \u00a0IV-2. \u00a0 The Constitution and National SecurityThe second component of Module IV examines the relationship between national security and the Constitution. National security is an inherent aspect of the constitutional order, and it is a misconception to think of a national security law merely as a criminal law or an emergency law.\u00a0IV-3. \u00a0 Law as Safeguard: General Principles of HKNSL The third component of the module guides students in learning about The Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKNSL) by focusing on its general principles. The innermost essence of this law is about the central government\u2019s overarching responsibility in safeguarding national security for all Chinese, country-wide and region-wide. HKNSL also safeguards the authority of the HKSAR government to lawfully guard national sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and other major national security interests in Hong Kong.\u00a0 \u00a0IV-4. \u00a0 National Security Framework CasesThe fourth and final component of the module discusses some recent court cases pertaining to HKNSL and the constitutional significance of these cases.
