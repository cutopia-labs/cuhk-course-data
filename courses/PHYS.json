The course aims at revealing the fundamental role that physics principles have been playing in the development of science and technology (S&T), which has drastically changed our ways of living and understanding of nature. Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students\u2019 daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future.

Recognize and appreciate the generality and beauty of physics principles and be aware of its working in nature, its impacts on technology and daily life.  Recognize and appreciate mathematics as the language of physical sciences and its fundamental role in all forms of engineering.  Analyze scientific information in public media and popular science contexts; and think critically on science related issues.

The physics of selected semiconductor heterostructures will also be discussed. Using semiconductors as the context, the students will learn and appreciate how quantum physics, statistical physics, and elementary solid state physics can be applied to understand much of semiconducting materials, which have transformed and will continue to transform technologies and the world.", "outcome": "1.
