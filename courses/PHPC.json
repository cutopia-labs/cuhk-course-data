How does the social environment interact with genes to influence health? What is medicalization and what are possible consequences of medicalization? How should health care systems be organized? In this course, we will examine some of these issues in the contexts of Chinese societies, such as mainland China and Hong Kong, and also offer comparative perspectives.", "outcome": "By the end of this course, students should be able to: 1.
