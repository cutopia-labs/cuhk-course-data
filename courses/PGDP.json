The characteristics are: (1) time is short (usually taking about 5 minutes in training one specific teaching skill); (2) number of students is small (about 3-5 students as \u201csimulated pupils\u201d); (3) teaching skills can be trained and practised individually, e.g. motivation, questioning, closure, body language... The training is recorded, then played back for analysis. The trainee-teacher reteaches the same skill until it is mastered.

The course holds that education is unavoidably value-laden and that moral values form an important core of the aims of schooling. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and a number of important approaches to moral education, and then compare these to other types of values education.

The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.
