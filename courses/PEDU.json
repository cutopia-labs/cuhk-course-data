The course will concentrate on developing students' knowledge and practical skills for conducting qualitative research in the following areas: (1) the use of relevant explanatory and exploratory research questions in different qualitative studies; (2) writing a critical literature review and theoretical sensitivity; (3) formulating a research protocol and the practice of triangulation; (4) hands-on experiences of collecting qualitative data with relevant data collection techniques; (5) data interpretation and analysis through coding practices based on the content analysis approach; (6) having theory building with the application of grounded theory; (7) developing skills to draw conclusions and write reports, both of which serve as the basis for preparing a doctoral research proposal and/or thesis; (8) special attention will be given to the issue of \u2018researcher as instrument\u2019 and related ethical issues.
