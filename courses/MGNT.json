The two-part GEL course sequence involves students in a cycle of receiving, experiencing, reflecting, and formulating concepts that in turn guide the understanding of live global experiences. In all, the GEL courses will fully engage students in apprehending global business knowledge through a concrete experience, deriving understanding through reflective observation, comprehending global business knowledge through abstract conceptualization, and transforming global business knowledge through active experimentation.The GEL course emphasizes the integration of academic contents and experiences of global business. Part I is a one-credit online course that disseminates fundamental concepts and frameworks of country differences, international trade, cross-border business activities, and operation of multinational enterprises. Upon completion of Part I, students can continue to take Part II, which is another one-credit course focusing on live global learning experiences. The global experiences can be categorized into outbound (e.g., term-time exchange, study trips, leadership-themed or citizenship themed international internships, overseas service trips) and inbound (e.g.\u00a0 local leadership-themed or citizenship themed internships or management consulting projects in multinational corporations or firms with strong global orientation). For those students who are not able to go out, they can choose to engage inbound GEL, e.g. internships at local or foreign MNCs in Hong Kong, or consulting projects on global business. For students who cannot fulfill either the outbound or inbound and have an urgency to graduate, the department may arrange study trips from time to time. With periodic guidance of the instructor, students independently reflect on and formulate concepts relating directly to their GEL.

Part I is a one-credit online course that disseminates fundamental concepts and frameworks of country differences, international trade, cross-border business activities, and operation of multinational enterprises. Upon completion of Part I, students can continue to take Part II, which is another one-credit course focusing on live global learning experiences.

Thus, for most firms international business is no longer an option it is a must.Differences between countries such as cultural differences and institutional differences have important implications for the optimal way to conduct business in a country.

Thus, we will learn strategies to make the internationalization process easier, and we will develop an understanding of the different modes of entry which are at our disposal and when different modes are preferable.

The course will also explore key design, management, and strategy issues multinational companies face. While this course will focus on international business broadly, for part of the course we will take a deep dive into how to do business in mainland China as an example of international business.

This course will also enhance your probing skills of obtaining useful information from business stakeholders, winning the pitches, handling objections and coping with Q&As. More importantly, you will learn how to close a deal at the end of the communication/presentation based on experiential learning and introduction of various effective and relevant models deduced from real working and business situations. The course will also introduce escalator pitch which has become popular and is a critical skill nowadays. When successfully deployed, it will improve your bargaining power and the chance of winning.
