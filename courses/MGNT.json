The two-part GEL course sequence involves students in a cycle of receiving, experiencing, reflecting, and formulating concepts that in turn guide the understanding of live global experiences. In all, the GEL courses will fully engage students in apprehending global business knowledge through a concrete experience, deriving understanding through reflective observation, comprehending global business knowledge through abstract conceptualization, and transforming global business knowledge through active experimentation.The GEL course emphasizes the integration of academic contents and experiences of global business. Part I is a one-credit online course that disseminates fundamental concepts and frameworks of country differences, international trade, cross-border business activities, and operation of multinational enterprises. Upon completion of Part I, students can continue to take Part II, which is another one-credit course focusing on live global learning experiences. The global experiences can be categorized into outbound (e.g., term-time exchange, study trips, leadership-themed or citizenship themed international internships, overseas service trips) and inbound (e.g.\u00a0 local leadership-themed or citizenship themed internships or management consulting projects in multinational corporations or firms with strong global orientation). For those students who are not able to go out, they can choose to engage inbound GEL, e.g. internships at local or foreign MNCs in Hong Kong, or consulting projects on global business. For students who cannot fulfill either the outbound or inbound and have an urgency to graduate, the department may arrange study trips from time to time. With periodic guidance of the instructor, students independently reflect on and formulate concepts relating directly to their GEL.

Part I is a one-credit online course that disseminates fundamental concepts and frameworks of country differences, international trade, cross-border business activities, and operation of multinational enterprises. Upon completion of Part I, students can continue to take Part II, which is another one-credit course focusing on live global learning experiences.

While in the past the international arena has been limited to large multinational corporations and even some large companies have only been active in their local market, today increasingly many companies, both small and large, engage in business which transcends geographic, political, and cultural boundaries. Thus, for most firms international business is no longer an option it is a must.Differences between countries such as cultural differences and institutional differences have important implications for the optimal way to conduct business in a country. Although the world is becoming more global, today more than ever people have an expectation that foreigners doing business in their country have an understanding of what management practices are normally used locally, and organizational behavior is still strongly influenced by people\u2019s cultural background. To be successful in this global economy, a manager must understand the effect diverse cultures have on how organizations work and be capable of managing multiple cultures interacting\u2014two skills this course will seek to develop. The course is highly interactive using case studies and simulations as well as interactive lectures and discussions to facilitate learning. This course will help prepare people planning to work in large and small firms alike to be senior executives making important international business decisions and acting as an effective international manager. Most managers agree that international business is not easy. Thus, we will learn strategies to make the internationalization process easier, and we will develop an understanding of the different modes of entry which are at our disposal and when different modes are preferable. This course will also study mergers and acquisitions which are becoming increasingly important in our world today. The course will explore key strategies for international business and also investigate how to interact with people from different countries most effectively, how to work on multicultural teams effectively, how to be an effective leader in different countries, and how to conduct international negotiations. We will also study how to deal with complexity and deal with multiple tasks at the same time which is an important challenge that international managers face. The course will also explore key design, management, and strategy issues multinational companies face. While this course will focus on international business broadly, for part of the course we will take a deep dive into how to do business in mainland China as an example of international business.

This course will help you acquire the necessary skills of a great communicator and break your psychological barrier when you need to present in front of a large audience. Unlike the other presentation workshops, we are not training for elocutionists. In this course, you will learn how to master the golden rules of communication in the real world and how to adopt a target audience based impactful dialogue to achieve your goal with long-term sustainable business impact. These audience groups may include investors, bosses, business partners and other business stakeholders. Delivering an eloquent presentation in a story-telling way is only the first step. This course will also enhance your probing skills of obtaining useful information from business stakeholders, winning the pitches, handling objections and coping with Q&As. More importantly, you will learn how to close a deal at the end of the communication/presentation based on experiential learning and introduction of various effective and relevant models deduced from real working and business situations. The course will also introduce escalator pitch which has become popular and is a critical skill nowadays. When successfully deployed, it will improve your bargaining power and the chance of winning.
