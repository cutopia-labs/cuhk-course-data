Through a careful sequenced selection of outdoor team activities, workshops, service and work projects, students are challenged to examine their orientation in life as they become college members in university. Success of the course hinges on balancing two axes of concern, namely, (1) between teamwork and personal development and (2) between inward reflection and outward expression.This course is the major common learning experience of college students across all disciplines and years, initiating a fresher's identity as a member of S.H. Ho College. The activity-based approach facilitates the cohort of freshers to bond together as well as to integrate with the college community.

Applying the fundamental skillset and mindset equipped in GESH2011, students would implement their service-learning project in local communities. Through a series of self-initiated service, self-reflection, and project presentations, students would consolidate their insights and experience from community service and be directed to examine the meaning and value of university education in real life.

Topic    Fundamental Concepts      Action    This Action component focuses on the implementation of community service in solving one of the below social needs:   Environmental sustainability  Food security and safety  Health and well-being  Quality education  Poverty and inequalities  Others   Students will start to prepare the action plan for service-learning activities. They need to liaise with the local community service providers and map out a detailed and practical proposal for their actions to take in collaboration with their selected partners.  They are encouraged to document the process of their service. The below elements need to be included:   Application of multi-disciplinary skills and knowledge and concepts of civic engagement  Direct interaction with service recipients, community members, community partners, or local organisations/ representatives   Through the experiential learning approach, this module aims to reinforce or examine students\u2019 skills and knowledge in the classroom.      Reflection    The Reflection component comprises two dimensions to maximise their learning:   Service-Learning Reflection  Self-reflection   After completing the community service, each group is encouraged to discuss three core questions:   What was the significance of your service?  What did you learn during your service that reinforces/ contradicts your learning gained in the classroom?  What are the difficulties encountered when addressing those SDGs in the local context?  What is the relationship of your Service-Learning Project (SLP) to the \u201creal world\u201d?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0    While each student is expected to write an individual paper, projecting their personal growth in terms of the meaning of knowledge and life. They could discuss three core questions:   What insights did you gain through your project that might assist you in your career or in selecting a career?  What impact might your project have on your life-long learning process?  What did you learn about community involvement, citizenship and civic responsibility?       Demonstration    In this module, students will demonstrate what they have learned throughout the process of service-learning through a more formal presentation, including a review of their proposal, community service, new findings, suggestions and reflections. This module aims to consolidate their leanings and extend the impact of their project to others through sharing their experiences.    \u00a0", "required_readings": " Service-Learning and Civic Engagement 1. \u7518\u70b3\u5149, \u80e1\u6587\u9f8d, \u99ae\u570b\u5805, & \u6881\u7956\u5f6c.
