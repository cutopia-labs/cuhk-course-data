The first half of the semester focuses on the development of jazz in the United States, surveying the rise of the music as an African-American art form over the course of the twentieth century, with attention to blues, ragtime, swing, bebop, modal jazz, free jazz, and fusion. The second half of the semester considers jazz as a transnationally circulating cultural form that is both a product of and a contributor to globalizing trends, examining jazz\u2019s circulations and permutations in contexts ranging from 1930s Shanghai to present-day West Africa. Through this course, students will gain a familiarity with the history of jazz, some of its major innovators, and its musical characteristics. Critical and close listening will be an important aspect of this course; through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples, students will gain aural skills that increase their appreciation and understanding of jazz music. At the same time, by examining jazz in relation to issues including race, ethnicity, political consciousness, globalization, and economics, students will develop skills in thinking critically about music\u2019s connections to social, cultural, and historical contexts.

The stories of Beethoven\u2019s broken family, failed love-life, and hearing loss have enthralled Western audiences as much as the sounds of his piano sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies. When the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, it was accompanied by Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d Yet, despite Western claims to Beethoven\u2019s universality, nowhere else in the non-Western world is Beethoven held in such esteem\u2013except for China. Since the late (if not even early) twentieth century, Beethoven has had more admirers in China than in the West. Who exactly is this Beethoven? And how was it that he, an Austro-German composer who read into Hinduism but never (so far is as currently known) into Confucianism, became a cultural icon both for and of the Chinese? Scholars still just do not know. In this course, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. By listening to and viewing Beethoven\u2019s masterworks and hearing/seeing them in both their original Western and Chinese contexts, we will debate what makes this one person collectively Western, Chinese, and universal (or not). In addition to listening and reading assignments, students will research an independent essay/concert review on Beethoven and his music, whether in Greater China, the West, or both.

This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health.

Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life\u2014after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life.

In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, \u201cHow can I live with the grief?\u201d This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.

Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (\u201cmindfulness breathing\u201d) and Satipatthana (\u201cfoundation of mindfulness\u201d) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living. Hopefully, they will cultivate a sense of self-compassion and connectedness with fellow human beings that fosters emotion management, harmonious relation and wise social action.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2306", "title": "Religious Art of China", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2306 is double-coded with FAAS2110. \nNot for Fine Arts Majors; and students who have taken FAAS2110. \nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2306 is double-coded with FAAS2110.)

Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the \u201cheart-source\u201d of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field\u2019s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like \u201c\u6c23\u97fb\u751f\u52d5\u201d (infusing ch\u2019i to show life movement) or \u201c\u610f\u8da3\u201d (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their \u201cheart-source\u201d. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting \u201ctranslates\u201d the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists\u2019 cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the \u201cheart-source\u201d of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits.

Violence is always political \u2013 whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 \u201cGender Equality\u201d, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 \u201cReduced Inequalities\u201d and SDG #16 \u201cPeace, Justice and strong institutions\u201d; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2637", "title": "Understanding Movies", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2637 is double-coded with COMM2930. \nNot for GCOM; COMM Majors; and students who have taken COMM2930. \nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2637 is double-coded with COMM2930.)

The first part equips students with specific film languages for film appreciation. The discussion of avant-garde movies and genre draws students\u2019 attention to the dynamics as well as the competition between the two major modes of cultural productions. The last part introduces a variety of critical theories that will lead the understanding of movies to the rethinking of significant issues of human concerns. Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their film analysis. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge from film specific to interdisciplinary approach and from film appreciation to critical evaluation. \u00a0 The following is an outline of the course: \u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Introduction: Film Styles: Realism and Formalism This lecture will introduce the two major styles of films: realism and formalism.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2668", "title": "Preserving Cultural Heritage", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Laboratory\nLecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2668 is double-coded with ANTH2730. \nNot for Anthropology Majors; and students who have taken ANTH2730. \nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2668 is double-coded with ANTH2730.)

These scenarios may include but are not limited to organ donation, resuscitation of a terminally ill loved one, withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for an end-of-life patient, active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as healthcare rationing. While a well-established legal and health system can provide guidelines for walking through these processes, the values and beliefs of the patients, healthcare workers, and other decision-makers (including family members and guardians) would shape the way decisions are made. Therefore, understanding the factors that may shape or influence one\u2019s values and moral beliefs is crucial for any meaningful discussions to resolve these dilemmas. This course will use a systematic approach to guide students in understanding the moral theories and principles pertinent to the works of bioethics, identifying the morally salient features and arguments of selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios, discussing and analyzing the main bioethical issues of those scenarios, as well as describing ways to resolve the relevant moral dilemma. Students will be introduced to different simulation exercises and scenarios to realize and reflect on the factors that shape their own decisions as well as moral values and beliefs. The course will utilize lectures, tutorials, case studies, and sharing of hands-on experience to guide students in adopting an all-rounded, holistic, and perspective-based approach to discuss and resolve the bioethical dilemmas related to health, life, and death matters.", "outcome": " After completion of this course, students will be able to: 1. illustrate the relationship between bioethics and moral beliefs in scenarios that concern health, life, and death; 2. illustrate systematically factors that may shape one\u2019s moral decision with regard to health, life, and death matters; 3. associate the bioethical principles with moral theories, apply them to reflect on and critique arguments and debates in selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios; 4. discuss and analyze the main bioethical issues and features of those selected cases and describe ways to resolve the dilemma between them; 5. identify the pressing bioethical issues concerning health and healthcare in Hong Kong, and initiate discussion based on the bioethical principles and theories covered in this course.\u00a0", "syllabus": " 1.\u00a0Bioethics and moral status: What makes living organisms possess moral status? The basis of moral status, and why human beings are considered to possess moral status form the foundation of the study of bioethics.\u00a0 As human beings are agreed to possess full moral status, this introductory lecture will engage students in a reflection on what humans are by nature, and how human is viewed from the moral perspective, i.e. what are the specific human features that ground human moral status. 2.\u00a0Moral theories: Consequentialist utilitarianism (the consequence of an action e.g. the number of lives that matters most morally) vs. Categorical deontology (the universal principle of the duty of the action itself that matters more morally) using classic trolleyology as example: what matters more? The strengths and limitations of the two main traditional moral theories. 3.\u00a0Moral theories: Principlism.\u00a0Recognize the origin of the 4 pillars of principlism. Identify the bioethical issues and features of scenarios in the medical and healthcare settings. Learn the principlist method to resolve the moral dilemmas identified among the four principles in different scenarios. Recognize the deficiency and limitations of principlism in resolving moral dilemmas - why principlism necessary but inadequate in addressing the dilemma of life and death issues in the public health and healthcare settings. (e.g. Who to save? Decision-making under limited healthcare resources.Treat or not treat? Life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for end-of-life and terminally ill patients.) 4.\u00a0Real life bioethical scenarios in Hong Kong and around the world.\u00a0Start a conversation: the pressing healthcare-related issues in Hong Kong (end-of-life care, organ donation, advanced therapies, Hong Kong Genome Project). Present some landmark and relevant local and international cases of bioethics in clinical and healthcare settings. Illustrate and analyze the moral dilemma and their respective bioethical arguments. Describe means of resolution of these conflicts.\u00a0 5.\u00a0Moral theories: Virtue ethics and character development.\u00a0From social psychology to bioethics: Milgrim Experiment. Does virtue exist in human beings or is it relative? Is pursuing virtue a meaningful project for human beings? Does character matter in bioethics? Describe the relevance of virtue and character to bioethics, power imbalance and coercion, bioethics in experiments and clinical trials (e.g. new drugs for a terminally ill patient), the importance of informed consent and the right to withdraw. 6.\u00a0Beyond reasons in bioethics: Emotions, intuitions, experience, and relationships. Hume\u2019s Sentimentalism as a moral theory (is moral decision governed by emotion or reason more?). How sentimentalism, intuition, experience and relationships influence decision-making in bioethics and healthcare settings. Who to save? Should relationship and feelings matter? Reviewing \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d scenario. Case discussion: organ transplant, resuscitation of terminally ill loved ones/family members, body donation. 7.\u00a0Beyond traditional moral theories in bioethics: Non-Western, religion, care, narrative, and feminist ethics.\u00a0Non-Western ethics: a summary of how Confucianism or other non-Western ethics (e.g. African bioethics) approach bioethical issues. Medical care against cultural or religious beliefs (Jehovah witness, non-therapeutic infant male circumcision).\u00a0Care ethics: Case-based perspective vs principle-based perspective.\u00a0Narrative ethics: An alternative but necessary method to bring particularity and lived experience into bioethics. Feminist ethics: is ethics gendered?\u00a0 How does feminist perspective contribute to understanding the pluralism of bioethics?\u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0Living in a pluralistic world of bioethics: Perspectives vs foundational approach to bioethics.\u00a0Monism vs. Pluralism: why we need to approach bioethics in a pluralistic manner? The limitations of monistic approach to bioethics. Why and how we should approach bioethics using different perspectives and lenses. \u00a0 Tutorials:\u00a0 1.\u00a0Decision-making in healthcare settings (with simulation exercise):\u00a0An introduction to how the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice are relevant and featured in healthcare scenarios. Identify the moral dilemmas in the scenarios, and reflect on the rationale behind the decisions.\u00a0 2.\u00a0Moral decision-making of life and death matters (with simulation exercise to inform AI decision making):\u00a0Moral Machine Exercise of Automated Car. Identify and reflect on feelings, sentiments as well as reasoning that go into the decision-making process. Recognize personal values and what shape one\u2019s moral decision regarding life and death matters. 3.\u00a0Case study: Bringing it all together:\u00a0Use case study to illustrate how a pluralistic approach to bioethics works. \u00a0 Glossary/Notes:  Care ethics: How about the genuine care and concerns for other people and living beings?  Feminist ethics: Can we treat the moral theories available not as foundations but different perspectives?\u00a0\u00a0  Minority ethics: What about the moral concerns of the minority?  Narrative ethics: How about the stories and experiences behind people\u2019s decisions?\u00a0  Principlism: Moral theories that are based on one single principle seems to be too narrow\u2026 how about one that has four?  Trolleyology: stems from the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d or \u201ctrolley dilemma\u201d invented by the contemporary British philosopher Phillipa Foot in defending the doctrine of double effect (the morality of killing to save the life of others). Trolleyology is an evolved version of the trolley problem with scenarios that trigger different moral considerations behind judgment and a chosen action.

In Unit 1, we orient ourselves in our current situation: the Anthropocene, the planetary period in which a single species, human beings, has become the dominant force shaping the present and future of the planet. We also acquire some core theoretical tools for investigating what we value and how we should live. In Unit 2, we ask what, if anything, we should care about beyond our fellow human beings. Should we care about animals, plants, and ecosystems, and how should we act towards them? In Unit 3, we turn to various complementary disciplines across the humanities and social sciences to explore how humans might live differently within and towards the nonhuman natural world. In Unit 4, we turn to questions of the future, asking what kind of world we should imagine and seek to bring about for humanity and nonhuman life, on planet Earth and beyond. Where relevant, we will explore these topics through regional and local examples.This course bears on several of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). With its special focus on environmental issues in Hong Kong, this course also addresses conservation concerns for Life Below Water (SDG#14) and Life On Land (SDG#15). The humanities and arts provide an alternative lens through which to understand today\u2019s economic, social, and environmental problems, and the needs of those affected by climate change. ", "outcome": " Upon completion of this course, students will be able to  analyse the major arguments in current environmental philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each;  understand how the humanities and arts shape our intellectual, evaluative, and emotional relationship to the environment;  articulate and critically reflect upon one\u2019s own attitudes towards the environment;  apply theoretical concepts in environmental humanities to interpret works of literature, film, and visual art, and critically evaluate their relevance for contemporary environmental issues;  synthesize ideas from a range of humanities disciplines to develop a composite, interdisciplinary perspective on complex contemporary environmental issues;  understand how philosophy, the humanities, and the arts contribute to Sustainable Development Goals involving climate action, sustainable urbanization, health and wellbeing, and conservation. \u00a0", "syllabus": "  Ethics in the Anthropocene   Living in the Anthropocene  Values and ethical theory    What should we care about?

These topics will be thoroughly explored from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, ensuring a fundamental understanding.\u00a0\u00a0SDG-9 Industry, Innovation and InfrastructureSDG-11 Sustainable Cities and Communities\u00a0Week 3-4: Inter/Transdisciplinary Practices\u00a0During Week 3, the course focuses on transdisciplinary approaches in defining and evaluating the social, economic, and ecological pillars of sustainability, reviewing practical tools within theoretical studies. Week 4 introduces \"Design Thinking: Trans-Species Wellbeing (Empathy) Mapping Studio,\" emphasizing design thinking in addressing complex \u2018wicked problems\u2019 real-life settings. Students develop creativity, empathy, and prototyping skills through interviewing, ideation, and rapid prototyping exercises. This week's focus is on designing human-centered solutions while considering the needs of diverse ecosystems such as soil, ocean, air, and forests.\u00a0Week 5-6 Environmental Art Case Studies\u00a0In Weeks 5-6, students will explore the diverse nature of environmental art and understand its significance in promoting critical thinking and dialogue about sustainability. They will learn how environmental art serves as a catalyst for turning ecological awareness into tangible action. The curriculum will cover the influence of artivism and eco-media on community engagement, awareness, and transformative action. Students will analyze case studies highlighting how artists collaborate with various stakeholders to tackle environmental challenges and the crucial components that contribute to the success of community-driven campaigns.\u00a0Mid-term interdisciplinary research presentation about students\u2019 plan for\u00a0 Common Good Project.\u00a04 Studio Sessions within CUHK Farm, Forest, Marine Lab, Air Quality Monitoring Centre at PGE Station\u00a0Week 7 Studio Soil: Sowing Seeds of Change with Relational Aesthetics\u00a0-- SDG Life on Land at CUHK farm\u00a0Session focus: Art, Science, and Farming Converge to Tackle Food System Challenges\u00a0In the soil session, students will examine the complex issues plaguing our food systems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and the pursuit of fair nutrition and farmer welfare. Students will do a short video piece on the farm or interview local farmers to learn about community shared agriculture.\u00a0\u00a0Week 8 Studio Air: Toxic Cloud, CO2, and Impressionism\u00a0SDG Target 3.9.1\u00a0 - calls for a substantial reduction in deaths and illnesses from air pollution.\u00a0\u00a0Session Focus: Intersection of Art and Atmospheric Science in the Context of Industrialization's Impact on Air Quality at CUHK\u2019s Air Quality Monitoring Centre at the PGE Station\u00a0\u00a0The air session of the course explores the intersection of art and atmospheric science in the context of industrialization's impact on air quality, as evidenced in 19th-century artworks like those of J.M.W. Turner. The analysis of nearly 130 paintings by climate physicist Anna Lea Albright, in collaboration with climatologist Peter Huybers, reveals a correlation between rising coal use, sulfur dioxide emissions, and a visible decline in air quality, reflected in the reduced contrast and white-hued shift of the paintings. Drawing workshop will be conducted in the Air Quality Monitoring Centre at the PGE Station after a brief introduction of how artists dealt with the theme of atmospheric pollution, pantone color grey and how scientists monitor air qualities in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a0Week 9 Studio Forest: The Whispering or the Roaring from the Wilderness\u00a0\u00a0SDG 13 \u2013 Climate Action at CUHK forest\u00a0Session Focus: The Synergy of Sound Art and Environmental Activism in Forest Conservation\u00a0In this session, students will juxtapose the immersive sound art of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's \"FOREST (for a thousand years\u2026)\" with an environmental activism in Germany's Dannenr\u00f6der forest led by Dr. Bente Castro Campos. Students will engage in a collaborative sound mapping exercise. They will venture into the nearby forest, equipped with recording devices, to capture the diverse acoustic signatures of the natural environment.\u00a0Week 10 Studio Ocean: Creative Service for Extreme Aqua Circumstances\u00a0Studio session at Marine Lab\u00a0SDG 14- Life Below Water\u00a0Session focus: Deep time manifested by art, science, and conservation in the ocean\u00a0In our ocean session, students will dive into the pressing concerns surrounding ocean warming, drawing inspiration from Susan Schuppli's thought-provoking work \"Learning from Ice\" and Jason deCaires Taylor's mesmerizing underwater sculptures. By examining the interplay between media art, marine science, and the Earth's deep time revealed by the depth of our oceans, students will explore how 'evidentiary aesthetics' can contribute to novel ways of scientific understanding and innovate new forms of knowledge. Students will aspire to create artwork that transcends mere representations of nature's beauty, instead taking an active role in documenting, restoring, and preserving marine habitats, thereby becoming agents of change in the face of environmental challenges, a process through which they will develop and demonstrate their know-how in their final co-creation projects.\u00a0Week 11-12: THE COMMON GOOD PROJECT Development\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each group will have 2 weeks to situate themselves to work with their chosen community, or collaborate with an artist's studio or a scientist's research laboratory. Students are required to regularly check-in and have interactive tutorials with their instructors, technical support team and/or science advisers (optional) to guide them through their co-creation process.\u00a0Week 13: THE COMMON GOOD PROJECT- Public Salon and Presentation\u00a0SDG 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\u00a0Students will present their final COMMON GOOD project, synthesizing their discoveries in the art and science of sustainability and co-creation, to a public audience composed of members from the scientific and artistic communities, environmental NGO partners, and peers. They will discuss the extent to which their group has successfully addressed the inquiries they brought into the course at the beginning of the semester, reflecting on their experiential learning journey and personal growth in embracing environmental stewardship.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1-2  Chakrabarty, D.

It introduces aesthetic concepts, film languages, and different schools and styles of film-making. It also explores the philosophical implications of films. Through selected films, students will be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and concern for the meaning of life. Discussion will focus on three categories: (1) films concerning humanities: the nobleness and darkness of human nature, the joy and sadness of love, and the absurdity of life; (2) films concerning virtual reality: the implications of the emulated world in sci-fi films, self-consciousness, and the crisis of false memory; (3) the metaphysical significance in films: the image of death, the origin of holiness and evil, and theism versus atheism.", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a0 Describe and analyze some basic concepts and theories of philosophy.\u00a0 \u00a0 Understand the basic concepts in film language and aesthetics.\u00a0 \u00a0 Discuss the philosophical elements of some major genre of films.\u00a0 \u00a0 Appreciate the contribution of philosophy to our understanding and appreciation of films.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reflect philosophically on our experience in daily life through film appreciation.\u00a0", "syllabus": "(1-5) \u6838\u5fc3\u5167\u5bb9\u3002\u4efb\u6559\u8001\u5e2b\u5fc5\u9808\u8b1b\u6388\u7684\u5c08\u984c\u00a0(6) \u9078\u9805\u3002\u4efb\u6559\u8001\u5e2b\u53ef\u81ea\u884c\u9078\u64c7\u8b1b\u6388\u7684\u5c08\u984c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6240\u5217\u50c5\u4f9b\u53c3\u8003\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u4e00\u3001 \u5c0e\u8ad6\uff1a\u96fb\u5f71\u85dd\u8853\u8207\u54f2\u5b78\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u00a0\u4e8c\u3001 \u96fb\u5f71\u7406\u8ad6\u8207\u57fa\u672c\u96fb\u5f71\u8a9e\u8a00\u00a0\u4e09\u3001 \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u54f2\u5b78\u610f\u542b I : \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u502b\u7406\u5b78\u00a0\u56db\u3001 \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u54f2\u5b78\u610f\u542b II : \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u8ad6\u00a0\u4e94\u3001 \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u54f2\u5b78\u610f\u542b III : \u96fb\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u5b78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u516d\u3001 \u57fa\u790e\u7f8e\u5b78\u7406\u8ad6\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "1.\u9676\u570b\u748b\u300a\u54f2\u5b78\u7684\u8ffd\u5c0b\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u5927\u5b78\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff0c2005\u5e74\u00a02.

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.", "outcome": "(1)

In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of \u2018collective memory\u2019 of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " It is anticipated that on completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 identify major areas and topics regarding the study of women\u2019s lives and experiences in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 analyse and discuss in what ways gender has been an organizing force in shaping families, professions, education, and social movements in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine one\u2019s self identity in complex historical and social contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evaluate competing narratives of a \u2018Hong Kong Story\u2019 from a gender and historical perspective  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apply first-hand knowledge and skills in writing history relating the personal to the social, cultural, political and economic contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 recognize the interconnections between different sources of inequality and oppression \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0critically engage with notions of social justice and social transformation  \u00a0  \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0A\u00a0 INTRODUCTION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Introduction: Revisiting Hong Kong\u2019s history (1840s -1990s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Methodology: Narrative, Auto/biography and Oral HistoryB\u00a0 WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: Servitude, Lineage, and Family Networks in pre-war Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Protected Women, san po tsai, mui tsai and concubines \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 Village women and boat women\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Merchants\u2019 daughters: women in the elite families \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C\u00a0 WOMEN AND FEMALE EDUCATION : From Protection to Modernisation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 European missionaries and nuns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 Local headmistresses and teachers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 Girls going to school and universityD\u00a0 WOMEN AT WORK: Gender, Work and Professions\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 Brothel keepers and prostitutes in the 19th Century\u00a0\u00a0 10 Nurses and doctors (1920s-1980s)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 11 Factory workers (1960s-1990s)\u00a0E\u00a0 WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM (1910s-1970s): Public Voice for the Private Sphere\u00a0\u00a0 12 Leaders of the anti-mui tsai campaign, the campaign against licensed prostitution, the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YWCA and the Family Planning Association", "required_readings": "Primary SourcesSelected documents from archives of mission societies, girls\u2019 schools, and charities.Published Secondary SourcesHong Kong History and Women\u2019s HistoryNgo, Tak-wing (ed.)

Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.

The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods.

Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

Since one of the course elements is the relationship of musical lyrics to musical sound, we will spend considerable class time listening to popular songs , paying attention to the way a lyric\u2019s meaning is conveyed through such elements as vocal style and musical arrangement.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2196", "title": "Appreciation and Practice of Environmental Writing", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2196 is double-coded with ENGE2520. \nNot for English; English Studies and English Language Education (ELED) Majors; and students who have taken ENGE2520. \nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGED2196 is double-coded with ENGE2520.) This course takes as its premise that environmental writing is environmental action. Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind. In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children\u2019s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing. Key questions this course explores:\u2022 How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?\u2022 What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues? How can we use writing more effectively to engage the public and effect environmental change?", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "1551", "title": "Psychology of Theatre", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for Psychology Majors.\nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "Psychology and theatre are integral parts of each other. Theatre explicates the psychology of human thinking and behaviors on stage and psychology processes underlie how artists enact their performance and how audience receives these performances. This is a general education course that introduces fundamental psychology concepts in the context of theatre. Students will learn emotions, cognitions and social processes of psychology and how they are integrated in the making of and experience of theatre. This course enables students to appreciate and analyze theatre from a psychological perspective. More importantly, this course allows students to understand oneself through psychology and theatre.While the title of the course is \u201cPsychology of Theatre\u201d, \u201ctheatre\u201d is broadly defined to go beyond drama to cover related performing arts like dance, music, opera and alike. All these art forms share common elements of using the human body as an expression of thoughts and emotions via text, songs, movements and/or instruments in the theatre. The focus and majority of the illustrations are still about theatre as in drama. Coverage including related art forms is intentional because the same psychological elements are applicable to these different art forms. For example, the function of theatre as emotional expression applies to music, opera, dance and drama. Stage fright affects actors/actresses and also musicians and opera singers. The use of body as non-verbal expressions is essential to drama and dance. Psychosocial and interpersonal conflicts as depicted in stories are common to both drama and opera.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "1741", "title": "Seeing the World through Maps", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Field Studies/Field-trip\nLecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for Geography and Resource Management; and Urban Studies Majors.\nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "Maps are not just for \"doing geography\".

Systematic analysis of laws, comprehensive evaluation, accurate forecast, rational planning, and efficient management can be achieved by using maps. This course introduces students the fundamental knowledge of maps, including the origin and development of maps, the social benefits and historical effects of maps, basic theory and technique of map use, different maps and their functions, and diversified applications of maps in the fields of national defense, economy, transportation, emergency response, public health, global change, etc. Modern cartographic technologies, such as computer cartography, remote sensing, geographic information system, and virtual graphical environment are also covered.

Mental illness is often considered as an adversary that should be dealt with by medical professionals. Challenging this monopolized medical discourse on mental illness, this course aims to expand the students\u2019 view to appreciate how mental illness has been psychologically influenced, socially constructed and policed, as well as culturally shaped. Coupling biochemistry\u2019s knowledge of mental illness with self-reflections, students are expected to develop a critical and comprehensive understanding of mental illness and mental health. With the use of experiential exercises, case studies, and film viewing, students will be further encouraged to scrutinize mental health issues in their daily lives. As there is a growing number of individuals challenged by mental illnesses both locally and internationally, students will have high chance of encountering an individual with mental illnesses in their social circles, workplaces or even family in the future. The development of a comprehensive and critical view towards mental illnesses will definitely prepare them to face this future challenge.[All students will be required to plan and organize a compulsory experiential learning activity for service users at a mental health agency/setting during Reading Week.
