We extend our exposition of traditional monetary policy to explain the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, as well as the essential factors contributing to the financial crisis which necessitated this unconventional monetary policy. We then move onto the interactions between economies as captured in their respective balance of payment accounts and exchange rate movements.

The class is designed for PhD students in management, economics, information technology, marketing, operations management, organizational behavior and related disciplines. For economists, this class offers the opportunity to apply economic tools to understand how information technology and information in general affect organizations and markets. For non-economists, this class offers an exposure to fundamental ideas in the economics of information, organizations, and markets. This course covers quantitative research methodologies in Economics of IS. It consists of three components: Methodology, Economics of IS Research Topics, and Writing and Publishing. The main goal is to prepare PhD students to produce publication quality research using tools from information economics.We will cultivate a culture of collaborative learning.
