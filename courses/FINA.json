Real world finance problems often deal with large datasets, traditionally with historical price and return as well as data on financial statements. More recently, other databases like consumer credit and online data (e.g., Google search, news media, satellite images, etc.) are also becoming more important for financial analysts. Dealing with such large datasets require tools to manipulate them, and we will introduce the use of Python and detailed instructions on how to perform analysis on large datasets. Once students become comfortable with the use of Python and manipulation of large sets, we will introduce students to tools in machine learning, which play an important role in our financial market, from approving loans, managing portfolios, to assessing risks.

The course also makes heavy use of statistics, and students who have difficulties with quantitative materials are not suggested to take this course.\u79d1\u76ee\u7d50\u675f\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u5b78\u751f\u80fd\u719f\u7df4\u638c\u63e1Python\u7de8\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0d\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5404\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u540c\u6642\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u5b78\u751f\u80fd\u719f\u6089\u904b\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5404\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e0d\u540c\u5834\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u554f\u984c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u79d1\u76ee\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u7de8\u7a0b\u8a9e\u8a00Python\u3002\u5728\u5b78\u671f\u958b\u59cb\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7bc0\u7de8\u7a0b\u548c\u7d71\u8a08\u57fa\u790e\u8907\u7fd2\u8ab2\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5b78\u751f\u70ba\u4e4b\u5f8c\u7684\u79d1\u76ee\u5b78\u7fd2\u505a\u597d\u6e96\u5099\u3002\u672c\u79d1\u76ee\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u8ab2\u524d\u5177\u5099Python\u7de8\u7a0b\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b78\u751f\u5177\u5099\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7de8\u7a0b\u8a9e\u8a00\u77e5\u8b58\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7de8\u7a0b\u7d93\u6b77\u3002\u540c\u6642\u672c\u79d1\u76ee\u5c07\u5927\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u7d71\u8a08\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u9078\u8ab2\u524d\u9700\u8981\u5c0d\u6578\u7406\u7d71\u8a08\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u77ad\u89e3\u3002", "syllabus": "- Introduction to Machine Learning and Applications in Finance- Cluster Analysis and Unsupervised Learning- Linear Methods for Regression and Classification- Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Flexible Discriminants- Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Other AI Applications", "required_readings": "The Elements of Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Inference and Prediction, by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.
