Food has always been an essential category in human culture. The amount of food surplus determines the strength and social bonding of a society; and rituals are usually revolved around food preparation, presentation, and distribution. In China, a large number of archaeological sites contained remains of food, and occasionally drink. This course picks the representative sites to illustrate what food meant to a society that can be summarized in categories listed below: 1. Consumption of staple food: rice and noodles; 2. Perception of tastes: sweetness and bitterness; 3. Cooking methods: steaming and roasting; 4. Exotic food: what had been imported to China and when? 5. Drinks: tea and wine; 6. Rituals that involved food. This course is suitable for students who have interests in Archaeology but may not have prior knowledge about it. It aims to prepare them for exploring the past of China in the future, either in form of class teaching or self-learning, or both. The course gets students to apply the designs and innovations of ancient China in regards to food and the practice of cooking, dining and rituals to the present.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to: \u00a01) Identify key recent archaeological discoveries of China;\u00a02) Analyze the functions and meanings of archaeological finds in particular contexts; \u00a03) Acquire research techniques in reading primary data; and \u00a04) Think critically about archaeological presentations, such as museum exhibitions, and relevant cultural events", "syllabus": "Part I: Discoveries of food and drinks\u00a0\u00a01.

Rice and Hemudu Culture (5500\u20143300 BC)\u00a0Carbonated rice husk was found in a number of early and mid-Neolithic sites in China. All evidence points to the origins in the mid and lower Yangtze River valley. This lecture uses Hemudu site as an example. The excavations over the last decades revealed many earliest finds in this Neolithic culture: rice paddy field, musical instruments, fortune-telling devices, etc. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a. \u300a\u6cb3\u59c6\u6e21: \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u8003\u53e4\u907a\u5740\u767c\u6398\u5831\u544a\u300b\u5317\u4eac : \u6587\u7269\u51fa\u7248\u793e 2003\u00a0b. \u8cc0\u8056\u9054\uff0c\u300a\u7a3b\u7c73\u4e4b\u8def:\u4e2d\u570b\u8207\u6771\u5357\u4e9e\u7a3b\u4f5c\u696d\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u767c\u5c55\u300b,\u300a\u6771\u65b9\u8ad6\u58c7\u300b2013\u5e7405\u671f\uff0c\u7b2c23-30\u9801\u3002\u00a0\u00a03. Noodles and the site of Lajia of Qijia Culture (c.2500\u2014c.2000 BC)\u00a0Lajia of Qinghai province is the Chinese version of Pompeii. It was a small town destroyed and covered by dust right after an earthquake. There preserved a bow of unfinished noodles made of millet (\u5c0f\u7c73) and husk millet (\u9ecd\u7c73). The noodles still carried a tinge of the original yellowish colour. This lecture begins with the finds at Lajia and refers to many other archaeological evidence of noodles consumption found in later periods. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a. \u738b\u660e\u8f1d\uff0c\u300a\u9752\u6d77\u6c11\u548c\u5587\u5bb6\u907a\u5740\u767c\u6398\u5831\u544a\u300b,\u300a\u8003\u53e4\u300b2000.12, \u7b2c12\u201428\u9875\u3002\u00a0b. \u8449\u8302\u6797\uff0c\u300a\u5587\u5bb6\u907a\u5740\u8207\u98f2\u98df\u6587\u660e\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u4e2d\u570b\u98f2\u98df\u6587\u5316\u300b2008\uff0c4(2)\uff0c45\u201476\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Jiaozi (Dumplings) and the State of Xue (?\u2014327 BC)\u00a0Jiaozi takes in different forms in Chinese cuisine. The earliest evidence came from a site in the State of Xue of the Warring States period (c.476\u2014221 BC).

Meat and wine and the Xianyang Airport site\u00a0In 2009, a bowl of meat soup was found in Xi\u2019an. Domesticated pigs, sheep and ox were found in as early as late Neolithic. Boiling was the primary method of cooking. In Xi\u2019an this tomb of the Han dynasty revealed the soup serving, as well as bottle of wine. This lecture illustrates a banquet in association with the many bronze cooking and serving vessels found. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a.\u9655\u897f\u7701\u8003\u53e4\u7814\u7a76\u9662\uff0c\u300a\u897f\u5b89\u54b8\u967d\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834\u5c08\u7528\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u5341\u516d\u570b\u5893\u767c\u6398\u7c21\u5831\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u6587\u535a\u300b2009.4\uff0c3\u201411\u3002\u00a0b. \u965d\u897f\u7701\u8003\u53e4\u7814\u7a76\u6240\uff0c\u300a\u6f22\u967d\u9675\u300b\uff0c\u5317\u4eac\ufe30\u6587\u7269\uff0c2006\u3002\u00a0\u00a06. Fieldtrip: Sauces and Seasoning\u00a0Sauces are not commonly found at archaeological sites. Because Hong Kong has a number of locally produced sauce workshops, a fieldtrip to one of them is enriching. The arrangement has to be made in due course. Otherwise, the fieldtrip may be a visit to a relevant museum exhibition in Hong Kong or Shenzhen.\u00a0\u00a07. Snacks and the early Han-dynasty tombs of Mawangdui, Hunan province\u00a0When food surplus is sufficient, snacks are desired. At Mawangdui, the tomb of the wife of the regional lord contained bottles of nuts, chestnut, and other food. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a. \u300a\u99ac\u738b\u5806\u6f22\u5893\u5e1b\u66f8\u300b\uff0c\u5317\u4eac\ufe30\u6587\u7269\uff0c1980\u201485\u3002\u00a0b. \u9673\u5efa\u660e\uff0c\u300a\u99ac\u738b\u5806\u6f22\u5893\u7814\u7a76\u300b\uff0c\u9577\u6c99\ufe30\u5cb3\u9e93\u66f8\u793e\uff0c2013\u3002\u00a0\u00a08. Tofu and the Han-dynasty Tomb at Mixian Dahuting, Henan province \u00a0Tofu was not preserved in any archaeological site. But the process of making tofu was recorded. At Mixian, the relief paintings found in the tomb illustrate the tofu-making processes in detail, along with other cooking and food preparing pictures. It remains a mystery as to why the people of the Han preserved such scenes in burials. But they provided insightful details about how these people perceived of food in relation to their afterlife. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a. \u6cb3\u5357\u7701\u6587\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u6240\uff0c\u300a\u5bc6\u7e23\u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893\u300b\uff0c\u5317\u4eac\ufe30\u6587\u7269\uff0c1993\u3002\u00a0b. \u99ae\u9e97\u9e97\uff0c\u300a\u79e6\u6f22\u98f2\u98df\u7565\u8003\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u5b9c\u6625\u5b78\u9662\u5b78\u5831 \u300b\uff0c2010\uff0c32(11)\uff0c79\u201481\u3002\u00a0\u00a09. Bread and the Western Xia Hoard of Inner Mongolia \u00a0Bread or bun did not survive well in most archaeological sites. But a hoard of Western Xia in Inner Mongolia revealed several well-preserved pieces. The Inner Asian forms of these finds related them to the Silk Road. In fact, a number of dried food examples came from that part of the world, because the dry weather favoured preservation. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0a. \u4f0a\u514b\u662d\u76df\u6587\u7269\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\uff0c\u300a\u51c6\u683c\u723e\u65d7\u767c\u73fe\u897f\u590f\u7a96\u85cf\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u6587\u7269\u300b1987.8\u3002\u00a0b. \u738b\u4ec1\u6e58\uff0c\u300a\u8003\u53e4\u8cb4\u5dde\u300b\uff0c\u96fb\u8996\u5ee3\u64ad\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002\u00a0\u00a010. Tea and the Liao-dynasty tombs of Xuanhua, Hebei province \u00a0Tea leaves have always been important in China. The cemetery at Xunhua belonged to a Han family living in the Liao regime. There were many pictures of tea preparation and serving. \u00a0Reading:\u00a0\u300a\u5ba3\u5316\u907c\u5893\ufe301974\u20141993\u5e74\u8003\u53e4\u767c\u6398\u5831\u544a\u300b\uff0c\u5317\u4eac\uff0c\u6587\u7269\uff0c2001\u3002\u00a0\u00a011. Exotic food \u00a0Chili, spices, potatoes, and a number of essential ingredients in Chinese cuisines came from abroad at different times. How did they manage to enter an established food culture? \u00a0\u00a012. Guest lecture \u00a0In China, food is a topic inevitably related to health, festivals and rituals. It will be exciting to include a lecture to be given by a specialist in Religious Studies, Chinese Medicine, or Maritime Trade, who has research interests in food. The lecture provides another dimension of looking at Chinese food.\u00a0\u00a013. Food and rituals \u00a0In conclusion, food is indispensable in social lives and rituals. In the examples discussed, food was always found in tombs, closely associated with the desires of nourishment, social engagement, and even hierarchy.

The course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld.

The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market.

Cultural Management as a New Discipline \u00a0This part introduces the historical and disciplinary background of cultural management. \u00a0\u00a01. Understanding Culture: history and theory\u00a0The first section presents an introduction to the course. As cultural management is embedded in the discourse of culture, this section explores the concept of culture and highlights the theoretical transition from the anthropological idea of culture as values and practices to the understanding of culture as a capital and resource. The emergence of the cultural economy concept will also be discussed. \u00a0\u00a02. Understanding the Discipline of Cultural Management \u00a0This section discusses the evolution of the discipline of cultural management over the past four decades, that is, from arts management, to cultural administration and management. It introduces the objectives of the discipline; the way that this discipline has been gradually accepted and subsequently widely practiced; and its closely related neighboring disciplines. It also discusses the professional role of cultural managers; their differences from artists and creative workers are highlighted.\u00a0\u00a03. Cultural Management in the Globalization of Culture-led Development\u00a0This section examines the discipline of cultural management from the view of the global movement that utilizes culture as a driving force for development. It discusses a set of concepts that emerged in the recent decades, such as creative industries, creative classes, cultural planning, culture-led urban regeneration and creative cities. It provides the historical background for the evolution of these concepts, discusses the issues and challenges that they encounter and their application in various local contexts. \u00a0\u00a0Part II. Managing the Arts\u00a0Art management is considered a traditional realm of cultural management. This part focuses on the managerial approach to the arts. Section 4 investigates the disciplinary relationship between cultural management and traditional management, and the peculiarities of art management. Sections 5 and 6 introduce preliminarily the management of two major art sectors: performing arts and visual arts. Sections 7 and 8 are concerned with cultural management in the social environment and discuss its connections to art marketing and administration. \u00a0\u00a04. Managerial Approach to the Arts\u00a0How to manage the arts? How is art management different from the traditional study of management? This section introduces the managerial approach to the arts. It explains the disciplinary relationship between cultural management and traditional management, and discusses how art management crystallizes the philosophy of both management and the arts. Art management covers four main managerial issues, namely, strategic management and planning, human resources management, finance and accounting and marketing and consumer behavior. The empirical implications of art management\u2019s peculiarities are also discussed. \u00a0\u00a05. Introduction to Performing Arts Management \u00a0Performing arts is one of the major subjects in art management. This section introduces the concept of performing arts and its management. It discusses basic performing arts programming strategies and its relationship with theatres and other performing art venues. Some basic modes of organizing performing arts and performing art agencies are discussed. \u00a0\u00a06.

The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China.

The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify the material and artistic features of some mainstream Chinese artifacts; develop interests in Chinese culture from the perspective of objects; identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; analyze the sources of Chinese heritage and traditions; think critically about historical and other relevant cultural presentations; and get prepared for further trainings in the disciplines of art history, archaeology, anthropology and history.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

The first section leads students to study the writings on aesthetics by critics from Plato to Foucault, whose arguments are still valid in inspiring many art exhibitions.

Indeed, there have not been many discussions of Chinese historical past independent of texts, and this course intends to fill up the lacuna.

Introduction: Why is material culture? What is heritage? \u00a0What is the difference between history and archaeology? Why should we pay attention to material objects? This session introduces the discipline of archaeology and describes its application in China. It defines what we speak of Chinese heritage from the perspective of material remains. \u00a0\u00a02. Neolithic China: The Rise of Numerous Jade-using Sources \u00a0As of 2014, more than 10 different Neolithic cultures have been identified in China. To what extent have we moved beyond the old understanding about Yangshao and Longshan cultures in central China? What do the new finds tell us about China during the Neolithic times (c.5000\u2014c.2000 BC). And how do they fit into the unified picture of what we call \u2018China\u2019 today. \u00a0\u00a03. The Shang period: the Dawn of Civilization \u00a0There are some textual descriptions about the Shang dynasty. But its archaeological boundaries are subject to debates. This session introduces the key Shang sites in Henan, as well as their contemporary sites found in Sichuan, Hunan, and other Chinese provinces. It leads student to pay attention to the interpretation presented in most Chinese museum\u2014all Bronze Age cultures were re-think the connections between the early Bronze Age and the present. \u00a0\u00a04. Western Zhou: The Early Development of Cultural Borrowings\u00a0Western Zhou is understood as one of the most esteemed periods in antiquity. This session looks into the archaeological finds from the 10th to 8th century BC and discusses what bronzes tell us about the several important political decisions the Zhou courts made to consolidate sovereignty. One key policy that the Zhou founders implemented was adaptation to various cultural streams collected from the preceding Shang and other neighbouring groups. This was an unknown yet profoundly important aspect of the Zhou that prepared it for taking the lead of what we today call \u2018Chinese\u2019 civilization. \u00a0\u00a05. Eastern Zhou: The Age of Conformity\u00a0The flourishing workshops of bronze-casting, lacquers, pottery, and textiles from the Eastern Zhou period provide a vast number of important archaeological finds. This session introduces some key sites, which include Sanmengxia and Leigudun. From them we will discuss the significance of material culture in forming shared heritage roots. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 45\u201463.\u00a0\u00a06. Han I: Burial Culture\u00a0The Han dynasty is a promising period with many textual records and archaeological finds. This first session looks into the Han tomb structure and burial goods, which present some interesting patterns in the religious ideas and practices of the period. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 65\u201497.\u00a0\u00a07. Han II: the Silk Road\u00a0Connections with the West were well-formed under the Han regime. This session looks at the finds from the Silk Road, which continued to be in use throughout the Han and its following centuries. This session reviews the finds from the Silk Road and discusses their significance for both the intellectual and public sphere in the present times. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 65\u201497.\u00a0\u00a08. Northern & Southern Dynasties: Buddhism in China\u00a0Buddhism began to appear in China from the Han times, and became vastly important throughout the divided Northern and Southern dynasties. This session introduces the key caves of Buddhist sculpture and discusses the impacts of Buddhist ideas on later Chinese material creations. In particular, Buddhism helped develop a range of ornamental features unprecedentedly formed in the context of China; yet those features have become central in the presentation of Chinese heritage today. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 99\u2014129\u00a0\u00a09. Tang Dynasty: The Cosmopolitan Cities \u00a0This session focuses on the settlement finds from the Tang period. Little is known about ancient Chinese cities or settlement sites, which were prone to destruction. This session leads students to reflect on the urban life in Metropolitan Tang, which was benefited from the access to various exotic goods acquired through the Silk Road. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 131\u2014161.\u00a0\u00a010. Song I: Antiquarianism and Imperial Collections of Arts\u00a0The Song dynasty was the age of the studies of antiquities. This lecture introduces the early catalogues of imperial collections that developed the sense of shared inheritance from the ninth century. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 163\u2014205.\u00a0\u00a011. Song II: Mural Paintings \u00a0Mural paintings are important finds from the tombs of the Song period. They usually represent the tomb owners in household quarters, engaged in various activities. More importantly, the neighbouring Qidan and Jin peoples also copied such tradition. This session leads student to discuss the importance in the exchange of burial practices and ideas. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 163\u2014205.\u00a0\u00a012. Guest lecture/field trip, venue to be decided. \u00a0This session will bring some fresh air to the classroom by taking students to look at modern presentation of Chinese material culture. The permanent gallery of the Hong Kong Art Museum will be a good choice. But it depends on the range of exhibitions available during the teaching period. If possible, a trip to visit the site in Guangzhou or Shenzhen will produce constructive impression about modern understanding of China past. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion and discussions of final papers. \u00a0This session summarizes the key issues collected from the above lectures. This is hoped to open up discussions for students to review the various sources of traditions that were gathered to form the core of Chinese civilization.", "required_readings": "1.

What are the essential elements of museum catalogues and cultural writing?3. How do museum workers balance both marketing and social needs?4.

Think critically about museum exhibitions and other cultural events.", "syllabus": "1 Introduction:What is a museum? \u00a0The introduction gives an overview of the museum structure and definition. This will introduce the various types of museums established around the world, defined according to the range of their collections. This will also compare the organization structure of a museum, in which the curatorial teams are working with a range of specialists relevant. \u00a0\u00a02 The history of museums \u00a0The \u2018history\u2019 of museum sounds alien to the context of museum studies. But museum workers are coming to beware that the museums are products of modernity that marked a distinctive times in which antiquities could be treated as shared, public properties. This lecture reviews the establishments of the Louvre and the British Museum in the 18th century; and discusses how \u2018museums\u2019 were contextualized first in Japan and later on in China. \u00a0\u00a03 Curatorship I: Exhibiting Authenticity and Interpretation\u00a0As the last lecture recalls, \u2018Museum as Ritual\u2019 has become an established social understanding\u2014museum is a place where esteemed objects are being exhibited and therefore recognized. The first problem that encounters all museum works is whether the objects they are showing, or the theme of the objects that they are presenting are \u2018authentic\u2019. In this lecture, we will look at examples of some early colonial museums and study the created themes that they presented. \u00a0\u00a04 Curatorship II: Organizing a thematic exhibition\u00a0Putting up a thematic exhibition (alongside the permanent exhibition) is a common practice in most museums. This lecture will give instructions as to what elements a thematic show should include. Then students are organized into groups to do a role play session for three parties: museum workers, overseas collaborators, and the donors. From this exercise, students will learn about the difficulties in negotiations and planning. \u00a0\u00a05 Curatorship III: Museum publications and cultural writings\u00a0The writings published for the museums share a common theme of identifying the artistic or historical values of the objects. In practice, however, there are various levels in addressing objects through literary practices. This lecture will look into some representative examples written for different targeted groups, which include children, pupils, and foreign visitors. \u00a0\u00a06 Museum and society I: Architecture and Design\u00a0Renovation projects were undertaken in numerous renowned museums around the world, because it has become aware that museums have to catch up with young generations and with the rapidly developed cities, in which they are located. This lecture will look into the case of Doha Quarter, where the locals took a deliberate attempt to a museum compound. From such we will consider the significance of architecture and museum collection. \u00a0\u00a07 Museum and society II: Education and Application of Digital Technology \u00a0Smartphones and other technological devices have become useful sources for museum presentations and visits. This lecture reviews some applications both within the museum building and outside it. The lecture will also respond to the concerns that digital technologies may exhaust public interests in the museum collections. With these both sides of argument, this lecture leads students to consider both the usefulness and shortcomings of digital technologies. \u00a0\u00a08 Museum and society III: Patrons, Donors and Volunteers, the sources of Funding and Support\u00a0Funding is always limited for cultural institutions. In this lecture, we will discuss the various potential fund sources for the museums. There is no standard way in the industry as to what the museum workers should do or write to apply for funding. But there are recognized sources about which they could get in touch: public visitors, membership programmes, volunteers, donars, and governmental resources. The key of the lecture is to develop an open mind to expand the coverage of funding from monetary values to public recognition. \u00a0\u00a09 Current issue I: Museum Branding and Marketing\u00a0Museum branding has been identified as a major marketing strategy for cultural institution. In this lecture, we will look at the suggestions of some successful museum workers and study their marketing approaches by creating a brand for museums. \u00a0\u00a010 Current issue II: Soft Power and the Political Roles of Museums.\u00a0As soon as Joseph Nye published his idea about soft power, which is based on the dissemination of cultural products or ideas, the discussion is always concerned with museum exhibitions. Museums could be taken as political statement of national treasures. In this lecture, we will discuss the ideas of Nye and look at how such concept has been interpreted in Asia. \u00a0\u00a011 Fieldtrip/site visit week \u00a0This week we will take some fresh air by visiting a local museum/site. \u00a0\u00a012 Current issue III: Museums and Contemporary Arts. \u00a0Should we include contemporary art in the context of museum? This is a difficult question that happens to most museums around the world. The well-used resolution is construction of a new venue dedicated to contemporary arts. The differences between the two disciplines\u2014museums and contemporary arts\u2014are related to the level of curatorship and public recognition. But the two themes seem to have blurred since the last decade. \u00a0\u00a013 Current issue IV: M+ and other museums in Hong Kong\u00a0In this last session, we will return our discussion to Hong Kong and look at what options this city has in comparison from what we have seen in other parts of the world. The M+ is dedicated to contemporary arts, or experimental arts; but the local museums remain fairly traditional in terms of collection and their range of exhibitions. Can Hong Kong develop a cultural hub? If so, what roles do these institutes would play?", "required_readings": "Topic 1: \u00a01. Burcaw, chapters 1 and 3. \u00a0\u00a0Topic 2:\u00a01.

The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to explain different national and social concerns for preserving culture; to identify the legal and ethnic issues relevant to cultural productions; to identify marketing strategies in cultural promotion; to evaluate the measures for maximizing the input of art practitioners; and to describe the various successful cultural schemes implemented in overseas countries.", "syllabus": "Section I: Culture in Context \u00a0\u00a01. Culture & States\u00a0The growth of cultural industries is strongly related to political environment and state policy. This lecture discusses the tension and mutual expectations between cultural workers and politicians. It will use the experience of the European Union and the US as examples. \u00a0\u00a02. Culture & Laws\u00a0Over the last few decades, there were a number of remarkable disputes over international art transactions and copy rights. Given the growing size of the art market, knowledge about the previous cases is essential. This lecture takes the examples taken from the US for discussions. \u00a0\u00a03. Culture & UNESCO\u00a0UNESCO is arguably a rising new power in forming a standard for evaluating cultural heritage of different nations. This lecture discusses the roles of UNESCO and its work in different cultural disciplines. National disputes over ownership of World Heritage sites will be bought up. \u00a0\u00a04. Culture & Community\u00a0Nowadays many nations and countries perceive culture and heritage as means to empower developing communities. This lecture discusses the conservation of indigenous or minorities cultures, and its impacts on the majority population of the same community. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture & Marketing \u00a0Culture and business are often taken as two contrasting disciplines. One of the key issues in cultural management is to develop cultural audience with both education and economic concerns. Religious sectors are a growing body of cultural venues for tourism and heritage management. This lecture discusses the debated concerns about conducting marketing or business-driven strategies in cultural and religious areas. \u00a0\u00a0Section II: Case Studies\u00a06. Cultural Management in Taiwan\u00a0Taiwan provides an excellent example to demonstrate the top-down organization of heritage sites. This lecture reviews a series of campaigns launched in Taiwan during the past twenty years, and discusses the reasons that may have contributed to engage the mass of Taiwan into different aspects of cultural industries. \u00a0\u00a07. Cultural Management in China\u00a0China represents many upcoming opportunities in cultural management. This lecture reviews some recent moves: rapid establishment of museums, growing number of commercial galleries and auction houses, rise of new Confucian schools, introduction of university degrees in cultural management, etc. The lecture discusses the consuming force underneath the cultural growth in the Mainland. \u00a0\u00a08. Cultural Management in Singapore\u00a0During the last two decades, the government of Singapore invested heavily on constructing cultural venues for both national and economic purposes. This lecture gives an overview of their establishment and invites students to reflect on the opportunities found in other areas of Asia. \u00a0\u00a09. Cultural Management in South Korea\u00a0This lecture discusses the contemporary cultural policies undertaken in South Korea. During the last decade, South Korea featured an economic miracle in Asia by rejuvenating the distressed financial market with cultural developments, which included the film industry, heritage protection, publication, and cultural tourism. \u00a0\u00a010. Cultural Management in UK\u00a0The United Kingdom was one of the earliest countries that invested heavily on promotion of cultural and arts events. This lecture gives a short history of the early developments made in the UK after the Second World War, and discusses the recent campaigns undertaken to break the boundaries between high arts and popular culture. \u00a0\u00a011. Cultural Management in USA\u00a0The United States distinguishes herself from all other countries by boosting the absence of a ministry for arts and culture, yet artists and cultural workers receive due respects for their contributions. This lecture looks at the case of the US and examines her success in cultural management. \u00a0\u00a012. Group presentation\u00a0This lecture is taken as a mock symposium for students to present their group projects and make comments on those by their peers. The presentation will be evaluated against the clarity and thoughts over the approved topics. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion: What is the best for Hong Kong? \u00a0This last session will summarize the topics covered throughout the course. Hong Kong is facing the challenge that many aspects of cultural developments in relation to urban planning, legislation, economy, national identity, and education are all pending. This lecture is an open discussion for students to brainstorm the possible approaches that Hong Kong could take in years to come.", "required_readings": "Week 1\u00a0Rosenstein, Carole. \u2018 Cultural policy and the political nature of culture\u2019 in J.P.

It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters.", "outcome": "Students are introduced to the basic concept of the culture-led urban development phenomenon, recognizing related concepts, understanding its history, and developing tendencies in the world. Then, they can gain a deep theoretical understanding of the origins of these practices in a capitalist political economic transition, the corresponding urban policies, and the urban governance modes. Moreover, students can learn how to conduct policy analysis and apply urban planning and design principles to provide consultancy for culture-led city development projects. The final products of group projects shall consist of policy recommendations and project consultancies for the Hong Kong government or other private sector developers.", "syllabus": "Part 1: Introduction to the Culture-led City Development Phenomenon\u00a01. Culture-led City Development: A Topic of Popularity\u00a0With a glimpse into a number of cities in Europe, America, and Asia that have implemented culture-led urban regeneration strategies, this lecture aims to spark the students\u2019 initial interest in this global phenomenon. This lecture identifies the disciplinary foundations of the topic\u2014from cultural studies, economic geography, and urban sociology to urban planning and design. Furthermore, this lecture examines the concept of culture in the culture-led city development phenomenon, emphasizing the increasing importance of culture in the related disciplines in the mindset of \u201cculture determining.\u201d The role of culture in generating profits, jobs, and other economic returns, being interwoven with local governance and identity is discussed. \u00a0\u00a02. Concepts, History, Rationale, and Debate\u00a0This section introduces a set of concepts closely related to that of \u201cculture-led city development,\u201d such as \u201ccities of culture,\u201d \u201cproperty-led development\u201d and \u201cculture-led regeneration,\u201d and differentiates the nuances among these concepts. The theories that argue for the role of culture in city formation and urban development are discussed, in which culture is viewed as resource or capital leading to symbolic economy that valorizes cities. A related issue is the role of cultural planning, which offers the resources and the framework in the process. The other theoretical source under scrutiny in this section is the importance of city or an urban environment to the growth of culture and cultural consumption. The writings of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Grame Evans are introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 2: Urban Sociological and Economic Approach to Understanding Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a03. Politics, Cultural Policies, and Culture-led City Development Strategies \u00a0This section explores the theoretical foundation of the culture-led city development phenomenon within the context of political economy. The transition of the capitalist production mode from Fordist economy to market-led post-Fordist economy has led to corresponding transitions in urban policies and urban governance modes, as well as to the adoption of public-private partnership. Culture-led city development strategy is a strategy, which is in line with the entrepreneurial urban policies. In addition, this section examines the connection between the culture-led city development strategies and the transformed cultural policies in cities. The broadening of the policy focus from art amenity provision to cultural economy development and urban cultural spaces planning has been identified as the most important policy context. Three stages of culture-led urban regeneration in terms of policies are also explained in detail. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a04. Economy of Culture and Arts in Cities \u00a0This section discusses the economic importance of culture and arts in cities. Culture is viewed as a new driver in urban economic growth, and the cultural sector is viewed as an indicator of urban economic growth. The economic importance of culture is associated with the so-called \u201csymbolic economy\u201d in cities, which involves upgrading urban images and boosting cultural consumption (e.g., urban tourism) within specific urban economies. Cultural and creative industries are the other main focal points of this lecture; thus, the geographic dimensions of cultural and creative industries are explored in this section. Furthermore, this lecture elaborates on the characteristics of cultural industry businesses and organizations, the geographic distribution of networks, and their production and consumption modes. Finally, a method to measure cultural and creative industries in cities is introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture-led Urban Regeneration Regimes and Cultural Strategies\u00a0Bianchini divides cultural culture-led city development strategies into culture-production-led and culture-consumption-led regeneration approaches. This section explores four types of production-led regeneration regimes and the consumption-led regime mode; cultural strategies and their interactions with modes of cultural production are also discussed. In addition, this section addresses the question of whether cultural strategies affect the conditions of cultural production. Finally, a method to fund cultural strategies is studied.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a06. Urban Governance and Partnership Modes in Culture-led City Development \u00a0What are the urban governance modes that match individual culture-led city development practices? The transformation of urban governance and partnership modes, which is a response to the change in the capitalist production mode, is an important issue in understanding of culture-led urban development practices. Partnership is not simply a transition from managerial to entrepreneurial form but a public sector-led management to local public-private partnership to manage their opportunities effectively in the global economic background. This section explores the characteristics of urban governance and public-private partnership. This knowledge can be applied in creating cultural quarters, CCJQs, and cultural facilities in Block 3. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a07. Critiques on Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a0Culture-led urban development strategies result in positive urban outcomes; however, they can also have negative impacts. This section presents the criticisms against culture-led urban development. For example, designation and zoning of cultural quarters often lead to the gentrification effect that cuts off poor artists from industrial studios. Flagship cultural facilities have a high chance of failure, often resulting in social exclusion and economic inequality and trigger tensions between cultural diversity and cultural hegemony. Moreover, the contribution of cultural projects to employment and GDP is questioned.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 3: Strategies and Mechanisms for Practice: Policies, Urban Planning, and Design Tools\u00a08. Cultural Planning and Creative Cities \u00a0This section introduces the concept of \u201ccultural planning\u201d as well as its goals, principles, and rationale for practice. The major steps for practice are discussed briefly. The second issue in this lecture is related to creative city and creative milieu. Based on the concept of \u201ccreative city\u201d introduced in CUMT1001, this lecture discusses the principles and methods to create a creative milieu for a city. Further discussions are based on the insights of Landry regarding the components of creative cities and Hall about the characteristics and preconditions for the creation of creative cities. \u00a0Mid-term Test\u00a0\u00a09. Boosting Cultural and Creative Industries in Cities \u00a0This section discusses a method of using policy and planning tools to boost cultural and creative industries in cosmopolitan cities. First, the three stages of cultural industry development in connection with cultural policy transformations in history are reviewed. Second, a method is introduced, by which policies for cultural and creative industry development can be designed and initiated. Sophisticated analyses of local resources of arts, cultural industries and their interconnections, along with production chain linkage and planning assessment, comprise the key steps in creating effective policy designs. The geographic convergence of cultural businesses and creative industry undertakings in the form of clustering has been argued to be a possible mechanism to facilitate the growth of cultural and creative industries. Finally, the principles and methods to generate CCJQs using policy and planning methods are outlined in this section.\u00a0Tutorial: Draft a proposal aimed at transforming Hong Kong into a creative city.\u00a0\u00a010. Planning for Public Arts, Arts Amenities, and Cultural Facilities\u00a0Developing cultural facilities through urban planning and design is an integral part of culture-led urban development. This section examines the position of arts amenities in urban policies through various historical stages, as well as the transition from emphasizing arts amenity provision to cultural facilities in urban planning. The main content of this lecture is devoted to providing instruction with regard to the ways by which to plan for cultural facilities in cosmopolitan cities, with an outline of the main approaches, such as providing cultural facilities as per the related planning codes with complementary methods of survey, designing a hierarchical system of cultural facility provision, developing facilities of mixed-use, and engaging member of the community. The anti-planning approach to creating cultural spaces is also included, the core concern of which involves a flexibly use of public and community spaces and family-centered virtual media facilities. \u00a0Tutorial: Analyze the policies of Hong Kong\u2019s cultural and creative industries, and draft policy recommendations for creative industry development in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. Creating Cultural Quarters \u00a0Cultural quarters, rooted in post-Fordist economy, have become an integral part of urban regeneration regime, which represents a transition in urban cultural policies toward a more comprehensive stage. This section discusses the political and economic importance of cultural quarters, the rationale of clustering cultural activities and creative industry businesses, and the typology of cultural quarters. Students are also introduced to the strategies and principles for creating cultural quarters based on Roodhouse\u2019s writings in 2006. Urban design skills to enhance the robustness of buildings and create vibrant street spaces and pedestrian spaces are complemented to Roodhouse\u2019s principles. Possible solutions to control gentrification are also discussed using the case of Lace Market. The final part of this section presents the instructor\u2019s consultancy project for the West Kowloon Cultural District.\u00a0Tutorial: Come up with recommendations for improving cultural facilities in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a012. Heritage Conservation and Historic Urban Quarter Revitalization\u00a0The significance of historical buildings and urban heritage sites in making a creative urban creative milieu and the process of disseminating symbols through cultural consumption-led urban spaces have been covered by previous sections. In this section, students are introduced to the historical transition and developing tendency of historic buildings and heritage conservation from preserving individual buildings to area-based conservation. With a clarification of the meaning of historic quarters, this section focuses on the selection of appropriate approaches or strategies that can be used in revitalizing historic urban quarters. These methods include preservation and conservation controls as well as physical and economic revitalization based on the assessment of the type of obsoletion. \u00a0Tutorial: Consultancy report for a cultural district in Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a013. The Workshop: Making Culturally Reenergized Cities\u00a0In this section, the final group is expected to present their group project on historical quarter revitalization in Hong Kong. To wrap up this course, the final section summarizes all the key issues and points. Supplemental instructions are provided based on the progress of the students\u2019 group projects, after which all comments on each group\u2019s projects are synthesized. One or two mechanisms might be introduced to strengthen the students\u2019 capacity to apply the theories learned, such as the evaluation matrix for cultural quarters and historic building reuses. A Q&A section is then included to answer students\u2019 questions concerning the knowledge in this course. Moreover, additional supervision for individual group projects is provided as needed.", "required_readings": "Bell, D. and Jayne, M. 2004.
