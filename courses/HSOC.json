To be effective, public health nutritionists must first connect the principles of nutritional science to the realm of public health practice in ways that emphasize the multi-factorial origins of actual nutritional problems in modern societies. In this course, students will be introduced to various essential elements of food and nutritional sciences. The current nutrition issues at both local and global levels will be discussed. The application of these on promoting nutrition health of the population will be illustrated.", "outcome": "By the end of this module, students are expected to be able to:\u00a0- acquire some understanding of the basic elements of food and nutritional sciences;\u00a0- describe and explain the current nutrition problems in developed, developing and third-world countries;\u00a0- make use of the above knowledge to design strategies to promote nutritional health of populations.", "syllabus": "   Introduction to Public Health Nutrition   Fundamentals (I) Basics of Nutritional Science   Fundamentals (II) Nutrition across the lifespan   Fundamentals (III) Nutrition Assessment in Individuals and Populations   Issues associated with over-nutrition   Issues associated with undernutrition   Food safety and major nutritional concerns in the modern world   Promoting Healthy Nutrition  ", "required_readings": "Please refer to the course outline provided by course teacher.", "recommended_readings": "1.
