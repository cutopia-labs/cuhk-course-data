Evaluation on how educational innovations promote student learning will also be explored. At the end of the course, students will develop a proposal that advances current educational practices in our society reflecting community needs and addressing the social inequality and poverty issues.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4210", "title": "Education, Technology and Human Development", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Discussion\nExercise\nLecture\nOthers", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Learning Design & Tech PC", "requirements": "", "description": "This course provides an introductory survey of the links between education, technological advancement and human development in the globe. While digital and technological innovation accelerates economic growth and plays a critical role for reducing poverty, it also trigger social inequality issues. Further, technological changes (such as computerization, artificial intelligence, etc.) will fundamentally alter the nature of professions and of high skilled jobs generally. The course starts with an overview of the current educational attainment and schooling investments across the world. This is followed by exploring the demand for human capital and educational investments aligned with economic development, public financing of education. Students will also be able to examine interactions between education, technology and development from social and economic perspectives on other issues, including compulsory education reform, manpower planning and curriculum reform, automation and its impact on jobs and labor market, gender gap in schooling and STEM subjects, welfare policy reforms and its impact on children.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4300", "title": "Instructional Design for Students with SEN in Technology-Supported Learning Environments", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Discussion\nLecture\nProject", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Learning Design & Tech PC", "requirements": "Not for students who have taken EDUC4340.", "description": "This course aims to provide students with fundamental knowledge of selected areas of special needs (learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder, emotional and behavioral disorder, and giftedness) and help them to understand possible learning difficulties children with these special needs would encounter.
