In addition, it is expected that students will be able to think about their own lives and personal meanings in a deeper and broader and more conscious way; in this sense, although this course is academic, it transcends the purely academic, to have a potential impact on students' own thinking about how to\u00a0live their lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the end of the course, students will be expected: a) to be able to think objectively, analytically and critically about meanings of life within their own and other societies, and understand the complex linkages between individuals and society in creating meaning, b) to be able to comprehend the broad panorama of the evolution of meaning over the course of human history, and c) (this objective, although discussed in class, is purposely left untouched by examinations) to be able to understand their own lives in a fuller and more insightful way.\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "(Note: Because this course is taught by only one person, all is core content)\u00a0Week One: Introduction and Course Overview\u00a0Part One: Meanings of Life Between Self and Society\u00a0Week Two: Meanings of Life in Anthropological Perspective: How the Anthropological View Differs from those of Psychology and Philosophy\u00a0Week Three: Meanings of Life as found in Work and Family\u00a0Week Four: Youth, Age, and Meaning Between Lifecourse and History\u00a0Week Five: Meanings of Life as found in Creation and Religion\u00a0Week Six: Self, Society and the Creation of Meaning\u00a0Week Seven: Meanings of Death: Why Societies Deny Death\u00a0Part Two: Meanings of Life in the Evolution of Human Societies\u00a0Week Eight: Meanings of Life and Relativism: Do We Know More Than People in the Past?\u00a0Week Nine: Meanings of Life over Cultural Evolution: h m Hunter-Gatherers to Industrialists\u00a0Week Ten: The History of Meaning in Europe\u00a0Week Eleven: The History of Meaning in China and Japan\u00a0Week 'helve: Meanings of Life in Contemporary Societies: Buying, Selling, and Sanity\u00a0Week Thirteen: The Future of Meaning: All the World a Disneyland?\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Week One: Introduction and Course Overview\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week Two: Meanings of Life in Anthropological Perspective: How the Anthropological View Differs from those of Psychology and Philosophy\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thomas Nagel, What Does It All Mean?(New York: Oxford U.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.", "outcome": "\u00a0 1.

This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them \u2018Chinese\u2019. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world\u2019s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People\u2019s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be \u2018development\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018sustainability\u2019 on the other. ", "outcome": " Upon completing this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 - explain why claims about being Chinese and Chineseness can be such a source of contention. - explain why there are similarities as well as differences across different Chinese societies. - historically as well as anthropologically account for the place of contemporary China within the world-system. - critically discuss the major features and social institutions of Maoist and post-Mao China. - discuss the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), their significance in our times, and how \u2018sustainability\u2019 challenges ideas of development in general and Chinese development specifically. - critically evaluate which of the 17 SDGs are realized \u2013 or compromised by - the Chinese development experience. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Core Content \u00a0 1.

Vignettes of Maoist China\u00a0 6. The Anthropology of Post-Reform China 7. Discussing post-reform China in light of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) \u00a0 What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese? And what constitutes Chinese society? When Chinese populations elsewhere (e.g. overseas Chinese) lay claim to being Chinese, what are they invoking? On the other hand, when ethnic Chinese Hong Kongers claim that they are not Chinese, for instance, what are they implying? Is being Chinese primarily given by ethnicity, nationality, cultural/civilizational practices, some combination of the above, or all of them?  This line of questioning would suggest that when we invoke \u201cChinese culture and society\u201d, we refer not only to culture and society in China but also beyond, to Chinese societies elsewhere that have emerged as a result of the Chinese diaspora. Yet at the heart of this discussion still lies the question with which we first began: what does it mean to be Chinese? And what binds mainland Chinese societies with those overseas?  Because the shared identity of being Chinese has here been shown to transcend geographical and national boundaries, I would propose that being Chinese pertains more to the evolving practices of culture than it does the more limiting constraints of ethnicity, geography, or nationality. This class therefore examines the constituents of being Chinese, with the emphasis placed on culture as its animating force.  Accordingly, we begin the course by underlining the significance of\u00a0 \u201cculture\u201d to being \u201chuman\u201d and trace out the implications of this proposition. (Topic 1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Indeed, it is because culture is a cumulative and evolving social phenomenon \u2013 a process - that accounts for the diversity of Chinese societies around the world (e.g. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), that there is something identifiably Chinese in each of them, yet something else that differentiates between them. A pluralist cultural view\u00a0\u00a0 of \u201cChinese\u201d - a civilizational view (?) - will thus be taken as we tease out the similarities and differences existing across these societies. (Topics 2 and 3).  After discussing the differences between the Chinese societies of the world, we will turn our attention to examining the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), whose breathtaking economic development over the past forty years is not in question. Because China - and the PRC, specifically - is a political entity that has had a history of antagonistic relations with the West, the course approaches discussion of China by first problematizing it as a political and historical entity, including its Maoist-Socialist past. (Topics 4 and 5). Such historic contextualization of China is felt to be necessary, the pre-requisite for any discussion of contemporary China, not least its post-Mao developments.  This brings us to the many aspects of post-Mao and post-reform China, the last forty years that have come to be associated with China\u2019s famed developmental experience. (Topic 6).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The consequences of Chinese development - especially in the post-Mao era - speak to most, if not all, of the SDGs, which can be understood to refer to sustainability in three realms: economic, social and ecological. Hence, the anthropology of post-reform China (6) will necessarily highlight issues pertaining, for instance, to poverty and hunger alleviation (SDG 1,2), health and well-being (SDG3), gender (SDG 5), inequality\u00a0 (SDG10), energy (SDG7), and urbanization (SDG 11), among others. This is conducive for a discussion about the SDGs with reference to Chinese development and an examination of whether or not, and when, they are consistent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0 Culture and Humanity Goodman, Mary Ellen. 1967. \u201cThe Nature of Culture\u201d.

We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. Part III Anthropology and the Business World discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business. Overall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked \u201csmart\u201d-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us \u2018more\u2019 human than previous forms of cultural life.

We will further explore how current social, technological, and cultural transformations of work can be understood across places, in their historic continuities and disruptions. Each week the course analyzes, discusses, and rethinks a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. Through reading contemporary ethnographies of different workplaces and circumstances, students will learn the analysis and theory of work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, factory, workshop, home, to online platforms.

Contemporary work often reorganizes time and new, flexible time regimes revolutionize our understanding of the work day.

While some workers perform their duties in public, others are confined to the domestic and intimate spaces of other people's living spaces. By contrasting the management of domestic helpers in Hong Kong with luxury hotel workers in San Francisco, we will think about how work discipline and evaluation influences performance, but also how the setting of work allows or prevents abuse. \u00a0 Constable, Nicole. 2017. \"Chapter 5: Household Rules and Relations.\" In: Maid to Order in Hong Kong: Stories of Migrant Workers.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?", "outcome": "1.

In particular, the cross-cultural perspective will demonstrate the intimate associations of these \u2018private emotions and desires\u2019 with social structures such as gender, class, ethnicity, and religion. It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential.\u00a0\u00a0The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? What have our desires got to do with social order? Why are some emotions and desires taboo?

They will also learn about the history and experiences of various ethnic groups to understand their current lives in today\u2019s world.

Different forms of social and cultural analysis will be applied to a range of local and regional case studies and students will gain an understanding of the key theoretical approaches to the anthropological study of medical knowledge, systems and practices. \u00a0\u00a0The role of medical practitioners and healers, and the political and socio-economic processes shaping the health of individuals and communities, including how ethnicity and gender shape disease profiles and illness experience, are examined. A key focus is on global inequalities in relation to health status, access and the affordability of health care.\u00a0\u00a0Running through the course is the in-depth investigation of illness experiences and help seeking in contemporary China where belief in Chinese medicine, biomedicine and regional healing practices co-exist. These practices are explored in light of the roles of local healers, family care giving and the different ways in which the body, birth, death and illness are managed. The explanatory role of Chinese medicine, local therapies, religion and culturally defined concepts of risk, vulnerability and fate in understanding sickness and healing is explored.\u00a0\u00a0Assessment:\u00a0Oral Presentation\u00a0Briefing Paper\u00a0Updated assessment will be announced in class.", "required_readings": "Course Outline\u00a0Introduction to Medical Anthropology\u00a0Reading\u00a01) Helman, C.

In North America, the discipline ofanthropology is typically broken into the four subfields of physical or biologicalanthropology, archaeological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and socio-culturalanthropology. Taken together, these four subfields give anthropology a unique, \u201cholistic\u201dperspective on the human experience, stressing the contribution of the biological as well asthe cultural \u2013 \u201cnature\u201d as well as \u201cnurture\u201d - in the formation of the human past and present.Yet, for reasons that will be elaborated, we will primarily be examining the many themes andsub-fields of sociocultural anthropology. This course can be regarded as a generalintroduction to the major currents within sociocultural anthropology.It is not unreasonable to argue that the concerns of sociocultural anthropology can be tracedto the distant past, when questions concerning social life first emerged (i.e. to the AncientGreeks in the West, or to the time of Confucius in China). But we shall begin our discussionof the story of anthropology closer to our time (i.e. the modern period), when the productionof social knowledge started to take on a more systematic and disciplinary guise. So, we willbegin our story of the development of anthropology when the discipline took on elements ofits current disciplinary constitution in the West. In fact, it is the aim of this course to helpstudents see the relevance of anthropological knowledge and analysis for understandingpresent-day realities.While the analytical focus is on the present, the present inevitably calls for an appreciation ofthe past. Analysis in anthropology thus involves the deployment of the conceptual to reflectupon empirical phenomena unfolding across time and space, along varying scales. As weinquire how the present is connected to the past, we are also compelled to ask how the local isrelated to the global. The empirical in turn informs and modifies the conceptual in an everiterativeprocess of knowledge-and-reality-making. In keeping with this, our discussions inthis course will involve a simultaneous focus on:i. Major anthropological concernsii. The contemporary human predicament and how we got here.", "required_readings": "Please refer to the latest course syllabus.", "recommended_readings": "Recommended Reading List/References:\u00a0\u00a0Bohannan, Paul, and Mark Glazer, eds. 1988.

These two areas of learning will enable you to think about societies past and present and about lives lived within these societies from a new perspective. You will also perhaps learn about how to think about your own life and meaning in a deeper and more conscious way; although this course is academic, it transcends the\u00a0academic, to have a potential impact on your own thinking about your life.\u00a0\u00a0Although this course examines meanings of life from an anthropological perspective, no prior knowledge of anthropology is required: you can apply what you learn in this course to a wide range of disciplines and endeavors.\u00a0\u00a0Assessment:\u00a01) Take-home mid-term examination OR an interview and analysis of a person as to \"life after death and life before death\" (10 pages long: 30% of grade) AND\u00a02) Take-home final examination (15 pages long: 50% of grade) OR a paper (20 pages long),\u00a03) Class participation and attendance: 20% of grade", "required_readings": "Introduction and Course Overview \u00a0\u00a0Meaning of Life in Anthropological Perspective \u00a0Tutorial: Thomas Nagel, What Does It All Mean? p. 87-101; Julian Baggini, What\u2019s It All About?

Students are encouraged to critically think about the interaction between biological, environmental and social factors in health and illness, and, as the world become more globalized, the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments, as well as global health.

By doing so it serves as an eclectic introduction to medical anthropology, a sub-field of anthropology that attends to the above-mentioned issues across socio-cultural contexts. The first half of the course deals with a series of questions that constitutes the heart of the field, including how culture shapes the representations of illness, how healing occurs in a local world, and how to make sense of illness experiences through narratives. The latter half of the course builds on the discussion of these questions and explore three themes that have become influential since the 1990s: social suffering, local biology, and structural violence. In the last two weeks of the course, we\u2019ll examine care\u2014a mundane yet indispensable act\u2014and its impossibility in the context of extreme violence.", "required_readings": "Film: excerpts from The Hole (\u6d1e), directed by Tsai Ming-Liang (\u8521\u660e\u4eae), 1998\u674e\u5b87\u5b99 2006 \u300c\u91ab\u9662\u88e1\u6b98\u5b58\u7684\u4e00\u9ede\u9109\u6101\u300d\u3001\u300c\u761f\u75ab\u7e7c\u7e8c\u8513\u5ef6\u300d\u4eca\u5929\u4e0d\u5beb\u75c5\u6b77 \u53f0\u5317 \u5fc3\u9748\u5de5\u574a\u5433\u660e\u76ca 2015 \u55ae\u8eca\u5931\u7aca\u8a18 \u53f0\u5317 \u9ea5\u7530 (\u7247\u6bb5\u7bc0\u9078)Film: excerpts from The River (\u6cb3\u6d41), directed by Tsai Ming-Liang (\u8521\u660e\u4eae), 1997.Rivers, W.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.", "outcome": "Students will\u00a01. understand how culture shapes societies\u2019 understandings of the body, love and emotions;\u00a02. comprehend how culturual, social, political, historical, and commercial aspects of body, love and emotions are lined and interrelated; \u00a03. be able to use ethnographic approaches to study of the body and emotions, in particular the value of participant-observation fieldwork methodologies;\u00a04. understand how the study of the body, love, and emotions contributes to central anthropological concepts, frameworks, debates and theories;\u00a05. be able to discuss significant issues concerning corporeal and emotional life in their own culture so that they can better comprehend how local identities are formed and contested in a globalizing world.", "syllabus": "This course seeks to denaturalise notions of love, body, and emotions by exploring their historical and cross-cultural diversity. Students will examine systems of meanings and practices that evolved around notions of love, body, and emotions across time and place, and their political significance. In particular, the cross-cultural perspective will demonstrate the intimate associations of these \u2018private emotions and desires\u2019 with social structures such as gender, class, ethnicity, and religion. It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential. The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? What have our desires got to do with social order? Why are some emotions and desires taboo? Is our body a product of nature or culture?", "required_readings": "Blaikie Andrew ...

Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls \u201ccultural landscapes\u201d (R\u00f6ssler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such \u2018non-material\u2019 meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong\u2019s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other \u2018hidden\u2019 landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their \u2018traditional\u2019 belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important \u2018ephemeral\u2019 landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept \u201clandscape\u201d, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go \u2013 by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time.
