This course will provide students an introduction to the major contemporary theories, theorists, and ongoing controversies in the analysis of human societies in all their diversity. Through the theories that these anthropologists and social thinkers have constructed to help them make sense of the societies they have studied, anthropologists address many key issues such as \"What role does \u201cculture\u201d play in a globalized world of movement, flows, and unequal power relationships?\", \"What is the relationship between the individual and society and how does this help us understand the complex relations between economic and political structures and individual agency?\", and \"How can the study of ongoing cultural diversity help us understand what it means to be a person within global capitalism and new media technologies?\" By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of the major theories and theorists in contemporary anthropology and be able to apply these theories to the analysis of society and culture in their own communities and contemporary life.\u00a0\u00a01.

This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts. Since Hong Kong, China, and Korea are following Japan\u2019s path of population aging, this course provides an opportunity to explore cultural issues that have a local and regional significance.", "outcome": "  Students will acquire a robust knowledge of contemporary Japanese society and culture. They will develop an understanding of cultural diversity within Japan and the broad shifts associated with population aging.  Students will gain the ability to apply anthropological theory to analyze Japanese society and culture. In conjunction, students will learn to critically evaluate scholarly and media portrayals of Japan. These critical faculties will also be relevant for understanding their own or other societies in daily life as well as for future anthropological studies.  Students will develop their writing skills. In addition to conventional academic essays, students will learn to write ethnographically about a specific site. Through writing, students will gain skills in communication of their own observations and perspectives on cultural features. These skills can be used for further academic study as well as personal and professional life. \u00a0", "syllabus": "Part I: Foundations of Japanese Culture and Society\u00a0Week 1.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues.

In order to maintain this image for its world visitors, there is no doubt that Hong Kong needs to find a balance between its global metropolitan aspect and unique cultural heritage with local characteristics in many ways. Yet, before moving on for extensive intangible heritage preservation, we might want to think about: What kind of heritage do we want to pass down to the coming generations? What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out?

This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them \u2018Chinese\u2019. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world\u2019s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People\u2019s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be \u2018development\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018sustainability\u2019 on the other. ", "outcome": " Upon completing this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 - explain why claims about being Chinese and Chineseness can be such a source of contention. - explain why there are similarities as well as differences across different Chinese societies. - historically as well as anthropologically account for the place of contemporary China within the world-system. - critically discuss the major features and social institutions of Maoist and post-Mao China. - discuss the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), their significance in our times, and how \u2018sustainability\u2019 challenges ideas of development in general and Chinese development specifically. - critically evaluate which of the 17 SDGs are realized \u2013 or compromised by - the Chinese development experience. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Core Content \u00a0 1.

Vignettes of Maoist China\u00a0 6. The Anthropology of Post-Reform China 7. Discussing post-reform China in light of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) \u00a0 What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese? And what constitutes Chinese society? When Chinese populations elsewhere (e.g. overseas Chinese) lay claim to being Chinese, what are they invoking? On the other hand, when ethnic Chinese Hong Kongers claim that they are not Chinese, for instance, what are they implying? Is being Chinese primarily given by ethnicity, nationality, cultural/civilizational practices, some combination of the above, or all of them?  This line of questioning would suggest that when we invoke \u201cChinese culture and society\u201d, we refer not only to culture and society in China but also beyond, to Chinese societies elsewhere that have emerged as a result of the Chinese diaspora. Yet at the heart of this discussion still lies the question with which we first began: what does it mean to be Chinese? And what binds mainland Chinese societies with those overseas?  Because the shared identity of being Chinese has here been shown to transcend geographical and national boundaries, I would propose that being Chinese pertains more to the evolving practices of culture than it does the more limiting constraints of ethnicity, geography, or nationality. This class therefore examines the constituents of being Chinese, with the emphasis placed on culture as its animating force.  Accordingly, we begin the course by underlining the significance of\u00a0 \u201cculture\u201d to being \u201chuman\u201d and trace out the implications of this proposition. (Topic 1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Indeed, it is because culture is a cumulative and evolving social phenomenon \u2013 a process - that accounts for the diversity of Chinese societies around the world (e.g. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), that there is something identifiably Chinese in each of them, yet something else that differentiates between them. A pluralist cultural view\u00a0\u00a0 of \u201cChinese\u201d - a civilizational view (?) - will thus be taken as we tease out the similarities and differences existing across these societies. (Topics 2 and 3).  After discussing the differences between the Chinese societies of the world, we will turn our attention to examining the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), whose breathtaking economic development over the past forty years is not in question. Because China - and the PRC, specifically - is a political entity that has had a history of antagonistic relations with the West, the course approaches discussion of China by first problematizing it as a political and historical entity, including its Maoist-Socialist past. (Topics 4 and 5). Such historic contextualization of China is felt to be necessary, the pre-requisite for any discussion of contemporary China, not least its post-Mao developments.  This brings us to the many aspects of post-Mao and post-reform China, the last forty years that have come to be associated with China\u2019s famed developmental experience. (Topic 6).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The consequences of Chinese development - especially in the post-Mao era - speak to most, if not all, of the SDGs, which can be understood to refer to sustainability in three realms: economic, social and ecological. Hence, the anthropology of post-reform China (6) will necessarily highlight issues pertaining, for instance, to poverty and hunger alleviation (SDG 1,2), health and well-being (SDG3), gender (SDG 5), inequality\u00a0 (SDG10), energy (SDG7), and urbanization (SDG 11), among others. This is conducive for a discussion about the SDGs with reference to Chinese development and an examination of whether or not, and when, they are consistent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0 Culture and Humanity Goodman, Mary Ellen. 1967. \u201cThe Nature of Culture\u201d.

Culture is ubiquitous in every aspect of societies, including how we do business. This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).", "outcome": " After the completion of this course, students will:  Understand and appreciate the cultural dimensions of business operations and organization in different historical, political, and social settings;  Acquire the necessary ethnographic skills to study diverse aspects of business operations and organization;  Be able to rethink and challenge the existing assumptions regarding business practices in the modern world;  Gain the analytical tools to examine issues of over-consumption, over-production, dispossession, oppression, and other relevant discontent under global capitalism;  Be able to examine critically the role SDGs could play in addressing disparities and injustices in the world;  Understand the importance of building a more inclusive, equal and diverse society. \u00a0", "syllabus": " The course is structured in three parts. Part I Culture in Business explores the cultural dimensions of workplaces and corporate management. We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. Part III Anthropology and the Business World discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business. Overall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).

These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives.

What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.", "outcome": "In this course students learn about the nature of scientific theories and their development, as well as the use of evidence in evaluating hypotheses. Students are also exposed to the potential for misunderstandings of scientific theory and the distinction between fact and value. Comparative abilities are emphasised through reviewing common features of the life-course of a variety of animals and the influence of animal habitats, with particular focus on closely related primate species.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of human evolution is introduced to students, focussing on the emergence of universal capacities such as language, technology, art and culture. Students are encouraged to learn about and appreciate the variety of human cultures and the flexibility of humans in adapting to local environments. A comparative perspective on human culture is encouraged through a focus on the common subsistence needs of all humans, and the variety of practices by which these needs are met.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Students are exposed to a wide perspective on the place of the human species in the world. They are encouraged to exercise long-term evaluations of, and exercise a sense of judgement about the impact and sustainability of human action, both in relation to the environment and other species as well as future generations of the human species. Students are thus encouraged to think about their own place in society.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "Weekly Topics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: Orientation and Course Overview\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution and Natural Selection 1: History of the Idea\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution and Natural Selection 2: Mechanisms, Examples and Some Common Misunderstandings (Teleology and Determinism)\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution of Mammals and Primates: History, Defining Characteristics and Current Diversity\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Characteristics of Living Primates\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 African Apes and Hominid Origins\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Human Ancestors\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Mid-term]\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Emergency of Modern Humans 1: Debates, Methods of Study and The Use of Evidence\u00a0Week 10\u00a0 The Emergence of Modern Humans 2: Technologies and Art\u00a0Week 11\u00a0 Human Adaptability to Local Conditions\u00a0Week 12\u00a0 Varieties of Human Subsistence\u00a0Week 13\u00a0 Humans and our Environments Today\u00a0Week 14\u00a0 Sustainability and Survival\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Key Reading Material\u00a0(see below for further reading)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading material for the topics will be available in the Library and/or provided in the form of handouts in class.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?", "outcome": "1.

It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential.\u00a0\u00a0The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology?

In North America, the discipline ofanthropology is typically broken into the four subfields of physical or biologicalanthropology, archaeological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and socio-culturalanthropology. Taken together, these four subfields give anthropology a unique, \u201cholistic\u201dperspective on the human experience, stressing the contribution of the biological as well asthe cultural \u2013 \u201cnature\u201d as well as \u201cnurture\u201d - in the formation of the human past and present.Yet, for reasons that will be elaborated, we will primarily be examining the many themes andsub-fields of sociocultural anthropology. This course can be regarded as a generalintroduction to the major currents within sociocultural anthropology.It is not unreasonable to argue that the concerns of sociocultural anthropology can be tracedto the distant past, when questions concerning social life first emerged (i.e. to the AncientGreeks in the West, or to the time of Confucius in China). But we shall begin our discussionof the story of anthropology closer to our time (i.e. the modern period), when the productionof social knowledge started to take on a more systematic and disciplinary guise. So, we willbegin our story of the development of anthropology when the discipline took on elements ofits current disciplinary constitution in the West. In fact, it is the aim of this course to helpstudents see the relevance of anthropological knowledge and analysis for understandingpresent-day realities.While the analytical focus is on the present, the present inevitably calls for an appreciation ofthe past. Analysis in anthropology thus involves the deployment of the conceptual to reflectupon empirical phenomena unfolding across time and space, along varying scales. As weinquire how the present is connected to the past, we are also compelled to ask how the local isrelated to the global. The empirical in turn informs and modifies the conceptual in an everiterativeprocess of knowledge-and-reality-making. In keeping with this, our discussions inthis course will involve a simultaneous focus on:i. Major anthropological concernsii. The contemporary human predicament and how we got here.", "required_readings": "Please refer to the latest course syllabus.", "recommended_readings": "Recommended Reading List/References:\u00a0\u00a0Bohannan, Paul, and Mark Glazer, eds. 1988.

Ethnicity, racial identity or national identity is one of the prominent categories by which people are divided in contemporary world. Some of us have clear awareness of our own ethnic identity; others don\u2019t. What makes the difference? Ethnicity is also the apparent reason of serious conflicts in the world \u2013 Kosovo, Darfur, and Rwanda, to name just a few.

Then, we examine the emergence of ethnic groups in relation to colonization, the rise of modern nation-states, and globalization. In the third part, we focus on the politics of ethnicity. We will also discuss the making, experience and expression of ethnicity in everyday life. Finally, we will reflect on two key issues: conflicts between ethnic groups, and human rights and equality between the minority and the majority peoples.

You do required readings and submit short reading notes to prepare for the classes and contribute to class discussion. To pursue further your own ethnicity-related interests, you will write a final paper. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "This course uses various ethnographies and research articles, but the following readings are some useful texts.\u00a01) Eriksen, Thomas Hylland 2002 (1993) Ethnicity and Nationalism: Anthropological perspectives.

These two areas of learning will enable you to think about societies past and present and about lives lived within these societies from a new perspective.

This course examines psychological experiences\u2014feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations\u2014from social and cross-cultural perspectives.

Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity?

The second part of the course examines the making (awareness, experience, production, and performance) of gender through various institutions and practices including family, education, nation-state, body and sexuality, production, and consumption. The third and concluding section of this course emphasizes the current context of globalization and explores particularly the impacts of migration on gender. We will revisit our initial questions about gender and culture and explore the intersection between gender and other categories of difference.\u00a0\u00a0COURSE REQUIREMENTS\u00a0This course is a graduate seminar and is designed to be a discussion-intensive one. You do required readings and submit short reading notes to prepare for the classes, contribute to our class discussion, and pursue further your own gender-related interests with a final essay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Part I: Introduction and Denaturalization\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\u00a0Introduce: 1) course organization, expectation & assessment; 2) discuss briefly about gender and our gender-related assumption.\u00a0No required reading.\u00a0\u00a0Gender and Anthropology\u00a01) Mascia-Lees, Frances E. and Nancy Johnson Black 1999 \u201cThe History of the Study of Gender in Anthropology.\u201d In Gender and Anthropology.

Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls \u201ccultural landscapes\u201d (R\u00f6ssler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such \u2018non-material\u2019 meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong\u2019s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other \u2018hidden\u2019 landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their \u2018traditional\u2019 belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important \u2018ephemeral\u2019 landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept \u201clandscape\u201d, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go \u2013 by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5790", "title": "Archaeological Field Study", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Field Studies/Field-trip\nLecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Anthropology", "requirements": "For students in MA Anthropology", "description": "This course will enable students to extend their archaeological learning in the classroom to an archaeological field site.
