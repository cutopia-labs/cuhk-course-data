In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should \u201c\u5916\u5e2b\u9020\u5316\uff0c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5fc3\u6e90\u201d (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the \u201cheart-source\u201d of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field\u2019s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like \u201c\u6c23\u97fb\u751f\u52d5\u201d (infusing ch\u2019i to show life movement) or \u201c\u610f\u8da3\u201d (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their \u201cheart-source\u201d. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting \u201ctranslates\u201d the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists\u2019 cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the \u201cheart-source\u201d of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies.

It will provide a variety of perspectives to discuss visions of the future presented by artists from diverse cultural backgrounds, who engage with such global issues as migration, borders, postcolonial conflicts, gender perspectives, environmental crisis, biodiversity, and digital capitalism. It will provide students with foundational knowledge on the emergence, developments, and challenges of global contemporary art discourses, as well as their contesting relationship with artistic autonomy and the society. We will examine a range of topics and methods employed by influential artists and thinkers in various geographies. This will provide a toolkit for understanding and curating contemporary art. To put critical thinking into practice, we will integrate exercises such as screenings and discussions, group projects, and exhibition proposals.

Develop skills in speaking in public and organize research materials. \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": "  Introduction: Autonomy In this introduction session, we will cover some fundamental ideas and debates of global contemporary art, including the issues of autonomy, timeline, and social engagements, referencing theories and curatorial practices since 1989. Drawing from selected international museum collections, we will unpack a variety of institutional and geopolitical contexts that contributed to the formation of global contemporary art. \u00a0  Feminism This session will be devoted to feminist criticisms in art history, specifically the dialogues between women\u2019s art and feminist movements between the 1970s and post 2000s. We will draw from several group exhibitions in Asia and the Americas post-1989 to discuss the issues of essentialism and representation in feminist Art histories. \u00a0  Queerness This session introduces various artistic approaches in deconstructing queer identities and bodies, mainly through selected case studies in digital and performance art. Students will be encouraged to compare these with discourses introduced during the last session, and discuss ways of decentering and expanding conventional feminist discourses. \u00a0  Migration In this session, we will examine the concepts of mapping and displacements in the context of specific political and environmental crises. To do so, selections of contemporary gallery films by minority or immigrant artists will be screened, followed by a discussion. \u00a0  Transculturality and Border Art Drawing from transcultural studies and border studies, we will examine several media and performance art works as well as curatorial approaches that cope with cultural conflicts and hybridity. Selected case studies include\u00a0Magiciens de la terre in Paris in 1989, the Whitney Biennale in New York, Asian Biennale in Taichung, and documenta Kassel.\u00a0 \u00a0  Colonialism This session focuses on visual art creations that address natural resource extraction and indigenous rights issues. It will start with an introduction to primitivism in modern art, then move on to reactions to Imperialism in works by South-East Asian and African artists as new nation states and identities emerge. \u00a0  Indigenous Art and Postcolonialism We will talk about First Nations land justice and reconciliation in this session. An institutional history of indigenous art will be covered first, then selected contemporary practices and their cultural representations under specific government policies. Particular attention will be given to discourses in Canada, Australia, and the New Zealand. \u00a0  Environmentalism This session introduces discourses of eco-art and the Anthropocene. We will also draw from political ecology to discuss artistic approaches to environmental justice. Issues of community engagement and green washing will be attended. \u00a0  Bio Art This session provides an overview on the history of bio art, its application in industries, the public reception, and the ethical issues. \u00a0  Digital Capitalism In this session, we will look at artistic reflections on surveillance and digital capitalism through concrete examples. We will screen selected essay films that engages with data discrimination, surveillance infrastructure, and deepfake, followed by a discussion. \u00a0  Asian Diaspora In this session, we will discuss the definitions of diaspora and the Sinophone through visual arts. We will look at artists outside of Mainland China who engage with \u201cChinese\u201d identities differently.

The presumption that artist cannot contribute significantly to public sector is questionable nowadays\u2014there are many experiments being done to show that artistic intervention can somehow arouse the awareness of hidden power and political structure of the society. As a citizen or an artist, art has a role to play in public space.Seeing public space as an arena for artistic expression becomes another focus in contemporary art.
