Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary \u2018populism\u2019 is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism. Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the \u2018rise\u2019 of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Part III of the course also draws briefly on comparisons between the primary causes of \u2018populism\u2019 in the European context, to the causes of \u2018localism\u2019 in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how a shift has taken place, with \u2018a new form of politics\u2019 now existing in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility.

It is a combination of scientific research in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and economics. Behavioral science theories have been used to better understand how humans perceive, think, and make decisions. The objective of this course is to enhance your understanding of the fundamental factors that drive human behaviors. By understand these factors, you may gain better insights into analyzing your own behaviors and developing strategies for behavioral management. For example, we will teach learning theories (how certain ideas become associated with each other over time; how people learn through conditioning processes) and use these theories to explain behaviors we observe in daily lives [1] [2]. We will also discuss three major theories from the Behavioral Economics literature, including \u201cprospect theory\u201d, \u201cmental accounting\u201d, and \u201chyperbolic discounting / intertemporal choice\u201d. These theories will help us understand how people value money, why human valuation of money does not simply depend on the nominal value of the money, and how people mentally track expenditures. Students who would like to read about these topics before course registration may consult the following one-page articles: [3], [4], [5] We will also introduce a simple model that guides behavioral change. We will discuss the EAST framework developed by the Behavioral Insight Team. Although the framework was originally developed for policymakers to guide their policy development, everyone can use the framework to guide their own behaviors.
