Addressing both the functional and aesthetic criteria of design is seen as compatible and contributing to a legible, non-derivative expression of form.\u00a0\u00a0Building technologies: catalyst for inspiration and basis for architectural strategy.\u00a0Materials and methods of construction play a key role in defining both the logic and the visual character of a building. The interplay between computer-controlled fabrication (mass customization), collaborative digital modeling (BIM) and integrated component assembly is driving many of the most innovative architectural designs today. However, in a world that is refocusing on the benefits of sustainable design, old and proven materials and methods of construction, seen in a new light, may also provide new inspiration for achieving low energy/low carbon footprint building design.\u00a0\u00a0Making: material, fabrication, connection and assembly.\u00a0Building is an act of making. Making involves both an activity of the mind (thought) and the physical action (skill) of fabricating and constructing. This studio views craft in construction as a design activity in itself. Decisions about the choice of materials, the methods used for shaping/forming, and the techniques employed for connecting/joining are all considered part of the design process. To better understand the implications on built form, the studio engages students in the design and construction of functional objects at full scale.\u00a0\u00a0Performance evaluation in the design process.\u00a0All building design is based to some degree on performance criteria. These criteria are either explicit or implicit in the building program. In order to predict and measure performance in a hypothetical or un-built design, some form of simulation is required. The studio employs several forms of simulation in design including physical modeling, full-scale prototype testing and various types of computer modeling to simulate the effects of structural loadings, airflow, lighting, and thermal conditions.", "required_readings": "Modern Architecture \u2013 a critical history.

The course offers a wide range of topics including: Urbanism, Building Technology, History & Theory, Digital Design and Design & Practice.
