This course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of the subject, students will be able to:  Describe some of the amazing designs in human body & their potential damages due to injuries, diseases, & ageing;  Give examples on how engineering has helped in reconstructing damaged body parts and/or body functions, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics, cardiovascular implants, artificial sight, tissue & genetic engineering, etc.;  Reflect on our human imagination about the bionic human of the future; and  Discuss some of the philosophical, societal and ethical issues associated with such technological development. Higher-Order Learning and Literacy: Students will be given sets of thematic reading assignments (listed as common reading requirements in the Reading List and Reference section), and asked to question, discuss, and illustrate their readings using some instructor-prepared worksheets as guides. Throughout the subject, students will be drawn to reflect on their views on the distinct characteristics of being human. Each student is expected to critically review one of the selected books (given in the Reading List, total reading not less than 200 pages) in a book report (~2,500 words). Life-Long Learning: In this interdisciplinary subject, students will be constantly facilitated and drilled to learn across their disciplines. We regard such an interdisciplinary learning capacity an important skill for life-long learning.", "syllabus": " Human life is both amazing and vulnerable. Amazing \u2013 the designs and working of our human bodies are the envies of engineering science. Vulnerable \u2013 the best and the strongest are still mortal. We are susceptible to trauma, diseases, ageing and finally death. Advances in life science and engineering are bringing to us in fast cadence and big strides innovative breakthroughs and new possibilities in healing and rejuvenation, functional recoveries and health enablement. Powered intelligent prostheses for subjects with amputation, fully implantable artificial hearts for subjects with heart failures, tissue engineered skin for severely burnt subjects, stem cells therapies for impaired brain tissues are examples that our body can be fixed by replacing the defective components with artificial \u201cspare parts\u201d and other augmentative measures. At the same time, research laboratories are developing intelligent robots that can see, hear, smell, talk, walk, dance, think, and feel like human \u2013 following a centuries-long human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machines. The mechanistic implications of these biomedical and engineering advances seem apparent \u2013 Is human a robot? Can robot one day become human? The artists among us are quick to perceive and even exploit these implications. The entertainment media have imaginatively presented many kinds of human-robotic hybrids, both as heroes and villains, often with power and abilities beyond those of a human. What could we tell about ourselves from our quests, pursuits, and dreams? How may one define the borderline between human and robot? What does it mean to be a human? \u00a0         Course Syllabus      Week    Session-1    Session-2    Session-3      \u00a01    Introduction  Course Management    Amazing & Vulnerable Human    YouTube Channels \u2013 Human Enhancement      State of Science in Biomedical Engineering      \u00a02    DVD: Understanding Stem Cells    Lecture:\u00a0DNA Engineering    Artificial Intelligence      \u00a03    DVD: The Brain: Episode 3 \u2013 Who is in control?

The history of energy consumption shows how important energy is to the quality of life for the human beings. With the further development and the increase of the world population, our society is challenged by an unprecedented energy demand in 21st century. At the same time, the global warming and climate changes are also causing more and more attentions. How can we meet the future energy demand? What are the energy options we currently have and what are their impacts on the environment? How can we meet our energy needs without deteriorating the environment? The first half of this course will tackle the above-raised questions by examining our current energy options and their respective impacts on the environment. Then, to address both the energy and environmental concerns, possible routes to develop a green society will be discussed in the second half of this course with a focus on renewable energy resources, smart grid, eco-friendly vehicles, and carbon sequestration and carbon audit. Lab experiments are expected to be conducted to formulate and design several different renewable energy systems toward constructing a green society.

However, very few people realize that climate has always been changing since the formation of the Earth. Even fewer people realize that the living things in their totality exert a significant influence in shaping the evolution of the climate itself. One striking feature of the current climate change is that it has arisen from the action of one single species Homo sapiens, owing to its ability to master the use of an enormous amount of energy.This course presents the story of the Earth's atmosphere since its inception up to the current time, illustrating the close interactions between the physical world and the living world. Observations about the life phenomenon are discussed, including the role of energy in the sustenance of life, individually and collectively. The changing climate has provided the context for the development of life on Earth, in terms of dispersion and diversity. The glacial periods have also shaped the habits and character of human beings. The arrival of the recent warm interglacial period facilitated the emergence of agriculture, enabling human beings to capture and utilize more energy in their life cycles. It brought about major changes to human beings' way of life as well as significant disruptions to the delicate balance in nature. Major turning points in history such as the emergence of civilizations, the conflict between nomads and pastoralists, wars and maritime colonialism are discussed in the climate context. Industrial revolution and modern consumerism are discussed in terms of their energy consumption and the associated emission of greenhouse gases, which has given rise to the current man-made climate change. Other aspects of this enormous use of energy are discussed, including urbanization, the attrition of the self and human beings' increasing detachment from nature. Latest projections of the climate in the 21st century and the potential consequences are presented. How the human world would deal with the potential of hazardous climate change will be explored, including the particular problems faced by China as it is about to develop further. It would be a time to reflect on the core human values and how they are to be expressed in the new low-energy world.", "outcome": "\u00a0Students are expected to develop a general and comprehensive understanding of the \"climate change\" subject from a multi-disciplinary perspective and to appreciate that climate is the result of the intimate interactions between the physical world and the living world. The course will discuss climate change from multiple perspectives of several physical and social sciences such as climatology, geography, geology, biology, history, and cultural and political studies. Therefore, students will not only gain basic knowledge of geophysical concepts and rules of climate, energy, and life, but also learn how climate change arises from the complex interactions between the physical environment and human society in geological and historical times. They will also learn to realize the phenomenal impacts of consumerism with its attendant energy expenditure, in the last half century on the Earth's climate. As concerned world citizens, students will need to be equipped with these capabilities and knowledge in order to better understand the emerging challenges posed by global warming and adopt mitigation measures for sustainable development.", "syllabus": " A. The natural world: This component covers the co-evolution of the physical world and the living world from the inception of the Earth up the point where agriculture emerged. The concept of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere as the collective breath of life on Earth will be developed. In that process, the fundamental characteristics of life as an energy phenomenon will be discussed, to bring out ideas about energy flow and various cycles in nature. How the glacial periods and associated habitat changes shape the habits and character of human beings will be discussed. Related course topics: 1. Introduction, atmosphere and climate; 2. Climate change, roles of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other agents in climate change; B. The world with agriculture: This component examines the emergence of agriculture during the latest interglacial warm period and what happened afterwards as human beings have more energy at its disposal. The climate and geography of civilization emergence in association with agriculture are discussed. The subsequent changed way of life and attendant problems are examined, with a view to prompting students to re-evaluate the role of \"civilization\" in life. The broad course of human history, especially the major turning points, in the time scale of thousands of years will be discussed in the context of climate and its variability. Related course topics: 3. Monsoon climate, Mediterranean climate, Semi-arid climate, floodplain and watershed; 4. and 5. Co-evolution of the physical world and the living world, agriculture and animal husbandry (I) (II) C. The burning world: This component places its focus on the post-industrial revolution period in which human beings has mastered the use of even more energy. The link between the burning of fossil fuel to rapid changes in the atmospheric composition and the climate will be described. Other consequential impacts will be discussed, such as changes in the natural world and more subtly those in the human society. The inter-connection among energy, technology, urbanization, consumerism and climate change will be explored. Related course topics: 6. Oil and war; 7. Coal and industrial revolution D. The future: The imminent hazardous climate change in the 21st century and choices available to human beings as a species will be discussed. Various countries will be examined, to illustrate the complexity of the issues involved and the very fundamental nature of the decisions to be made. Related course topics: 8. Global climate governance and carbon neutrality; 9. Carbon neutrality in individual countries; 10. Energy and climate geopolitics in 2050 and the rise and fall of economies", "required_readings": " \u6797\u8d85\u82f1\u8457\uff0c2010.\u300a\u5929\u5730\u8b8a\u4f55\u8655\u5b89\u5fc3\u300b\u5feb\u6a02\u66f8\u623f.

And they are also real and hot crises affecting the sustainability of human beings. How do we know these are all happening? In fact, our earth is being overseen from space every day. One good example is Google Earth that takes us any part of the globe anytime and anywhere using fingertips. Have you wondered where do these images come from? How these images are captured? How can images be used to understand the happening on our earth? Most of these images are captured by giant machines hovering in space known as satellites. \u201cRemote sensing\u201d is the process to collect images from the space or in the air, which is one of the key tools in the regime of spatial information technology. Important information are extracted from these images to gain better understanding of status quo and be more sustainable and responsible to our home \u2013 Earth.This course allows students to acquire basic knowledge of remote sensing and to understand how the technology is used to the study and monitor of our earth. The course is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates the basic concept of remote sensing as well as the skills in extracting information from images. The second part unveils the applications of remote sensing images to crucial sustainability issues such as urban development, agriculture, forest management, natural disaster, climate change, etc. These applications connect with three Sustainable Development Goals including #11 (sustainable cities and community), #13 (climate action) and #15 (life on land) set by the United Nations in 2015. Loads of remotely-sensed images are used to illustrate the natural process and human activities that alter the earth surface and to explore the issue of sustainability.

This interdisciplinary course invites students to analyse and appreciate music from two scientific perspectives, namely, psychology and AI. It begins with musical elements, which are the basic building blocks of music, from the viewpoint of both music perception and production. The science behind those elements is explored with an emphasis on how they evoke emotions. We then examine the basic concepts of AI and its capability of producing music applications including music emotion recognition and automatic music composition.

Since 1978 the economy has grown rapidly and as of to date, it has become a rising economic power of the world. However, the environmental and ecological problems have reached a point whereby sustainable growth is jeopardized. To solve the problems of limited resource per capita, as well as encourage economic development, China has implemented and planned for a series of mega projects of far-reaching repercussions, the scale of which is unmatched in the history of mankind. They range from multi-purpose water conservancy projects to renewable energy projects and inter-provincial railway construction. These projects have been conceived for decades yet highly controversial and expensive to build. Meanwhile, China has made a commitment that it will shoulder the responsibility of implementing the 2030 development agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs), and seek solidarity and cooperation to constantly push the cause of global development. This course gives students a general background of these mega-projects, the problems they attempt to resolve, benefits, as well as how these projects trying to meet the SDGs (especially the SDGs 6, 7 and 13 of water scarcity, affordable clean energy and climate actions, respectively), and the potential collaborations with other countries contributing to human well-being.

We are all fascinated by the mushrooming of transnational companies; the increasing cross-boundary flows of resources as well as the increasing competition among places and cities. Resource becomes a keen issue due to the growth of population, trade and economy in the age of globalization. Good management of resources will thus be both global and local concerns. In this regard and with the advent of the global agenda 2030, there is increasing enthusiasm in addressing the most pressing and challenging issues that the world is facing today, and these are Globalization and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).This course will thus focus on the interaction of man and environment in a geographical context with special reference to a selection of relevant SDGs. By adopting different perspectives, a variety of resource issues ranging from natural resources to economic and human resources will be examined. The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will be the discussion of basic concepts of globalization and resource issues in the society that are related to selected SDGs. The second part will be issue-based analyses of different resource issues that affect lives in modern societies and that could make a difference in the pursuit of the SDGs particularly in this age of globalization. Various cases in the real world will be analyzed. This course will help students to broaden their views on the SDGs and understand the importance and implications of resource issues in both developing and developed countries.", "outcome": " Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, including lectures, video shows, forum and group discussion on current issues, the student will be able to:  understand the basic concepts of resource issues and globalization  develop analytical and critical thinking capabilities through the discussion of various case studies and current issues  students will be able to develop self-awareness and reflect their roles in local communities and at the international context  enhance the skills necessary for interpreting relevant planning and management of resources in the society \u00a0", "syllabus": "  Globalization and the World System: How does it affect me?

Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to make products, has already led to the new industrial revolution, which creates hundreds of thousand jobs and tens of billion dollars revenue in the United States. This course aims to introduce students some fundamental knowledge of how genes determine and control our appearance and behaviour. Recent discoveries of some genes in inheritable diseases (e.g. cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc.), aging and death will be addressed. Successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal, agricultural and environmental practices will be introduced.

THE BASICSBiology, Facts, and the Scientific MethodBiology is the study of life. The facts in biology are really attempts to state our current understanding of the natural world around us, based on observations that we make and experiments that we do. Biology is rich with examples of facts that were once widely held but have since been superseded as biologists have tramped on to a better understanding of the phenomena those facts attempted to explain. Biologists, as well as other scientists, have made new and better information available with a systematic approach called the scientific method. In this lesson, brief history of the emergence of modern biology will be introduced. Renowned scientists and how they have contributed to the discovery of cell and DNA using the scientific method are introduced, so that the students can get a sense of what the scientific endeavour is like.\u00a0Cell: A Basic Unit of LifeCell is the basic unit of living organisms. Cells are not static but are dynamic in nature. They have the capacity to grow, to response to stimuli, to adapt to environmental changes, to become differentiated and specialized, and most importantly, they can duplicate themselves exactly by divisions. Nearly all the genetic information needed to direct these activities are contained within the chemical deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inside the nucleus. During this lecture, some structural, functional and genetic characteristics of a living cell will be introduced.\u00a0The Central Dogma of Directional Flow of Genetic InformationDNA from all organisms is made up of the same chemical and physical components. The DNA sequence is the particular side-by-side arrangement of bases along the DNA strand. This order spells out the exact instructions required to create a particular organism with its own unique traits. The genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, and the DNA in the human genome is arranged into 24 distinct chromosomes. Each chromosome contains many genes, the basic physical and functional units of heredity. Genes are specific sequences of bases that encode instructions on how to make proteins. Although genes get a lot of attention, it is the proteins that perform most life functions and even make up the majority of cellular structures. In this lesson, the central dogma of directional flow of genetic information will be addressed, which provides the background knowledge for the following lectures.\u00a0The Book of LifeThe Human Genome Project (HGP) is an international research programme, involving more than 2000 scientists at 20 institutions in 6 countries, to characterize the genomes of humans and other organisms, to develop novel technologies for achieving the goals, and to address the ethical, legal and social impacts of this new information. Although the possibility of sequencing human genome was first discussed in the mid-1980s, the project was only officially started in 1990. After a 13-year work, which is 2 years shorter than it was initially expected, the finalized sequence of the human genome, with 99.99% accuracy, was publicly announced on 14 April, 2003. Some of the novel insights and interesting findings about the human genome will be addressed in this lecture.\u00a0II. ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUESA coin has two sides. Although human genome research and biotechnology improve our living quality, they also introduce us some ethical, legal and social problems that greatly attract public attentions and worldwide debates. Some of these foreseeable issues will be discussed, including:\u00a0Privacy, confidentiality and fairness in the use of genetic informationWho should have access to personal genetic information, e.g. employers, courts, schools, government agencies, etc.? How will it be used?\u00a0Commercialization of genetic information and its productsShould the genetic information donors or the commercial companies own the property rights of the developed products?\u00a0Psychological impact, stigmatization, and discriminationHow does personal genetic information affect self-identity and society's perceptions?\u00a0Uncertainties associated with gene tests for susceptibilities and complex conditionsShould testing be performed when no treatment is available? Should children be tested for susceptibility to adult-onset diseases?\u00a0Health and environmental issuesAre genetically modified (GM) foods and other products safe for human and the environment? How will these technologies affect developing nations' dependence on industrialized nations?\u00a0III. GENES, HEALTH, AND DISEASESModern genetics has had a profound impact on medicine. Although connections between certain diseases and inheritance were made centuries ago, only during the past decades that geneticists become understood the metabolic basis of several hundred inherited disorders. Detective genes that result in the inherited disorders have been isolated. The genes in normal individuals are called wild-type genes; those with defects that result in the synthesis of nonfunctional products are called mutant genes. They result in abnormal or mutant conditions. These detects in mutant genes are called mutations. In this lecture, some of the better-characterized genetic diseases will be introduced, and the connections between gene mutations and inheritable diseases will be addressed:\u00a0What Causes Cancer?\u00a0 How Cancer Arises?Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in our society.\u00a0 Incidence and development of cancer is affected by both heritable gene mutations and environment (including our living lifestyles).\u00a0 Recent studies have shown that cancer is a result of unnecessary cell divisions and resistance to proper cell death.\u00a0 Although gene mutations cannot be prohibited, improving our living quality can markedly reduce the incidence of cancer.\u00a0 Recent knowledge on the causes and development of cancer will be introduced, and some preventive living practices and the recent and prosperous future curative methods will also be discussed during the lesson.\u00a0Why Do We Age?Aging is the chronological process of an individual's life along a time axis, and senescence is the deterioration process associated with aging. Aging cannot be halted but senescence can be slowed down. Several theories accounting for the significance of individual's aging to the population will be introduced in this lesson. Moreover, some classical studies showing causes of senescence and corresponding ways to slow down the process will also be discussed. Results of these studies have already paved the route of development a number of so called \"anti-aging\" nutraceuticals or food supplements in our market. Finally, a genetic disease called Werner Syndrome, which is caused by the mutations of WRN gene and pre-mature senescence, will also be addressed.\u00a0IV. BIOTECHNOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IN DAILY LIVINGSBiotechnology for Improving Our Quality of LifeNowadays, researchers can cut apart the genome to figure out what the individual parts do. They can make changes to a gene and replace one gene with another. This \"cutting and pasting\" is called genetic engineering, which is the heart of a whole new industry called biotechnology, the use of living things to make products. While many biotechnology creations are still in the experimental stage, a number of them are already on the market. During the lecture, some of the successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal and agricultural practices will be introduced, e.g. replacement of genes for repairing the genetic defects, duplication of organisms as donors of tissues and organs for transplantation, engineering of some crops to make them more resistant to insects and diseases, creation of new crops with bigger harvest or containing more proteins so that they are more nutritious, etc.\u00a0Molecular Biology for Finding the TruthCourt cases hinge on scientific evidence, and forensic science serves as an interface between law and science. Instead of depending solely on the smudged fingerprints left at the scene of a crime, because of the advancement of molecular biology, investigators could now look at a new kind of \"fingerprints\" called DNA fingerprints, which is the unique signature found in each person's genetic makeup. This DNA-fingerprinting technology, which has been regarded as a revolutionary tool in forensic science, has already helped a number of court cases to condemn the guilty or to exonerate the innocent. In this lecture, the theory and procedures in preparing the DNA fingerprints and its analysis will be introduced. Some of the best-known cases involving DNA evidence will also be considered, as an illustration of the value and vulnerability of using DNA as evidence.\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": " For Lectures: The Nature of Biological Science  Losos J.B., Mason K.A. and Singer S.R.

Among which, agriculture is the foundation of all sedentary civilizations as it systematically provides food and other products to sustain human lives. It is an art that integrates knowledge of nature with human needs and values, evolving side by side with the development of science and technology. Today, with the advancement of scientific technology, the highly industrialized modern agriculture has greatly increased food production to support the global population growth. Yet it also brings global ethical concerns regarding sustainability, food safety, biotechnology, pollution, etc. In the past decades, increasing attention has been given to permaculture, an alternative agricultural practice that emphasizes the development of durable and self-sufficient ecosystems in farming. Permaculture is not only a practice of sustainable food production, it is also a philosophy of living with nature.In this course, students will learn through lectures the basic knowledge about modern agriculture and its applications of science and technology; understand the fundamental principles, philosophy, and practice of permaculture; discuss the ethical issues related to the use of science and technology in modern agriculture; reflect on the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals, such as \u201cZero Hunger\u201d, \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy\u201d, \u201cSustainable Cities and Communities\u201d, and \u201cResponsible Consumption and Reproduction\u201d.

While there are common principles and practices for protecting the environment, local contexts might add to the intricacy between humans and their environment, and thus create multiple perspectives for intellectual pursuits. For example, cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) share and enjoy a lot of marine resources in the Pearl River Delta. However, coastal cities in the GBA, including Hong Kong and Shenzhen have been heavily impacted by pollution arising from rapid economic transformations and industrial developments in the last few decades. For such a global issue, concerted efforts have been made in scientific studies, implementation of international policies and strengthening of local governance to restore the damaged environment and properly manage our natural resources. Progress has been made but environmental issues remain a huge challenge to mankind.This course aims to engage students in re-examining some current strategies for environmental protection at national, regional, local and even personal levels, by guiding them to study selected prevailing environmental problems, general practices of the society and some representative interregional collaborations in the GBA. While general principles in environmental science will be outlined, this course will focus on water resources, management of pollution in the coastal area and regional collaborations upon the issues. To gain first-hand experience in the present situation of their own city and neighbouring regions, students from CUHK and CUHK(SZ) will participate in field trips and scientific investigations. Tutorial discussions and writing assignments are learning opportunities for students to reflect on and evaluate the implementation of current environmental policies and interregional collaborations in the Greater Bay Area, in terms of the possibilities those policies and collaborations have brought, their significance and issues arising from them.

Biodiversity, conservation, environmental management, and related technologies are essential and are brought together under this bigger theme of sustainability. Biotechnology, here thus plays a great role, as it infiltrates in different part of our lives \u2014 from the food we eat to how we collect them, the drugs we take to treat illnesses, the fuel we use to power up devices and even the conservation of biodiversity and the environmental health. While biotechnology is a broad discipline that exploits different biological processes, organisms, cells or cellular components to develop new and effective technologies and is a newly emerged and an ongoing field in biological sciences, it offers opportunities to aid achieving different global matters that are happening currently or in the foreseeable future, especially issues relating but not limited to food crisis, one health, energy shortage, sustainable infrastructure and biodiversity in different habitats, etc.This course provides a wide scope of knowledge relating to biotechnology that aims to stimulate thoughts and broaden the horizon of students from different background.

All lectures will be conducted by teachers from the School of Biomedical Sciences. Each lecture will start by introducing some basic knowledge of the topics and then move into relating its relevance to the understanding of disease conditions. The impact of some latest advances in medical sciences on mankind will also be discussed. Perpetuation of life and maintenance of life processes Medical sciences help us to better understand the upholding of the healthy, normal status of our body. The seven lectures in this area will illustrate the general anatomical and physiological concepts for understanding the sophisticated yet highly coordinated mechanisms involved in the conception of life and normal functioning of the human body. Topics include:        \u00a0Topics    \u00a0Learning Contents      \u00a0Fertility and infertility    Reproduction is essential for the continued existence of a species. This lecture provides a brief overview on the physiological control of gamete production in men and women, and various factors that determine fertility and contribute towards infertility. Various methods of contraception and how they work will be introduced.      Miracle of life    This lecture gives an account of the human reproductive system and the prenatal development of the human embryo inside mother\u2019s womb. It covers the human embryonic development starting from a fertilized egg which then grows to a cluster of cells and gradually changes and develops into a fetus during pregnancy. It also touches on test-tube baby and techniques for assisted reproduction.      A beautiful mind: wonders of the brain    Our memories, emotions and actions determine who we are. All these are functions of the brain and this lecture will reveal the important features of this mysterious anatomical structure.      Body composition and body fluid    Water makes up of about 60% of our body weight. The various functions of water in humans and the physiological regulation of total body water volume and its contents will be outlined.      Cardiovascular diseases and treatments    Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart diseases are the most prevalent medical conditions in the Western society. This lecture will briefly cover the organization and physiological control of the cardiovascular system. Besides, the common causes of cardiovascular diseases and the basis of current drug treatments will be introduced.      Wireless control in our body: hormones    Hormones are chemical messengers which act as wireless control of life processes in the human body. Travelling from the site of synthesis to distant target tissues or organs via the bloodstream, hormones can exert widespread influences over a long distance. In this lecture, the control and function of various endocrine systems, as well as the causes and symptoms of common endocrine diseases will be discussed.      Life at the extremes    Majority of the human population live in areas close to sea level. The body is highly adapted to the air pressure and oxygen content at this altitude. When a lowlander ascends, the pressure becomes lower and oxygen content reduces, body has to adapt to this new environment. A highlander lives at high altitude for thousands of years and their physical performance is much better than a fully adapted lowlander. The physiological and genetic adaptation process will be described.    \u00a0 Health issues and physical disorders An understanding of the body defense system and disease mechanisms is important for the maintenance of health and the choice of effective treatments. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in physical disorders induced by deterioration of normal physiological functions or by exposure of the body to foreign substances/organisms will be examined. Topics included:          Topics    Learning Contents      Body defense    Our defense system is a body-wide network consisting of organs, tissues, cells, and small molecules that work together to fight against \u201cforeign\u201d invaders and different kinds of stressors. This lecture aims to introduce the mechanism of body defense and response to infection as one source of body immune reaction. The common hospital-acquired infections and epidemiology will also be discussed.      Targeting our genes    In human, genetic codes are stored in DNA. The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs of nucleotides. Any mutations in the DNA sequence may lead to genetic diseases. The goal of the Human Genome Project is to determine the complete DNA sequence in human. In this lecture, basic knowledge of genetics as well as the causes of genetic diseases will be introduced, and the importance of the human genome project in the study of genetic diseases will be discussed. Enormous progress on genome editing has been made in the past few years. The genome editing tools and prospects of this technology will also be discussed.      Avoiding the top killer - cancer    Cancer is a major killer disease that has long haunted mankind. Carcinogenesis refers to the development of cancerous cells from normal cells. In this lecture, different causes of carcinogenesis and the impact of human activities on the development of cancer will be discussed.      Drugs that we take    This lecture aims to provide students with a basic understanding on what are drugs, how they are discovered, and how they work. General pharmacological principles which are important for understanding the proper use of drugs as medicines will be discussed. Drug abuse and its harmful effects will also be described.      Healthy aging    Aging is a natural process that causes a gradual slowdown of body function and increases the risk of developing diseases. This lecture will explore the effects of aging on different body functions and discuss the strategies that can be used to delay the process of aging and prepare the body and mind for a healthy aging.    \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": "\u00a0 1.

In this lecture, the definition and characteristics of stem cells will be introduced.\u00a0Methods for stem cell preparation and the potential applications of stem cells for medical therapy will be explained.\u00a0Current problems and ethical issues on stem cell usage will be discussed.  \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sense and sensibility \u00a0 The molecular and cellular basis of different sensation will be introduced.\u00a0Common sensory disorders and the effects on childhood development will be explained.\u00a0Current advances in diagnosis and treatment will be discussed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growing up \u00a0 The immune system in our body helps to protect us against disease by identifying and killing any pathogens from entering the body.\u00a0However, over-reactivity of this life-saving system will cause allergy that will make troubles for us.\u00a0Allergic diseases that are commonly found in Hong Kong, like rhinitis and asthma, will be introduced. \u00a0 Beside allergic diseases, other problems may arise when we grow up from childhood and enter into adulthood.\u00a0In the past, under-nutrition is a problem in many parts of the world.\u00a0Nowadays, the problems of over-nutrition and unbalanced diet are becoming more serious in many countries. \u00a0 Coupled with the lack of exercise, obesity is a common problem among many working adults in Kong Kong.\u00a0Also, a stressful working environment together with the bacterial infection has made gastric problems commonplace in Hong Kong.\u00a0If we continue to neglect the warning signals from our bodies, we may finally suffer from lethal organ failure.  1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergy  The immune system protects us against disease by killing the pathogens that enter our body.\u00a0Disorders of immune system occur when the immune response is hypersensitive, or lacking.\u00a0Allergy is an immune response excited by allergens.\u00a0Allergens that are commonly found in Hong Kong include house dust mite, cockroaches, and house moulds.  \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Obesity \u00a0 This topic will discuss diet, energy balance, healthy body weight, life styles, genetics and environmental factors in relation to overweight and obesity.\u00a0It will also emphasize how obesity increases the risk of chronic diseases.\u00a0The methods to treat obesity will be briefly introduced, including dietary intervention, behavior modification, medications and surgery. \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gastric problems  The Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine for 2005 was awarded to Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren for establishment of the linkage between Helicobacter pylori and gastric diseases.\u00a0The bacteria colonized in the stomach induce many changes in gastric secretion.\u00a0This topic will address the basic science and clinical manifestation of gastric diseases. \u00a0 \u00a0  C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The invaders  \u00a0  The human race is in a state of constant battle with our environment.\u00a0This struggle for survival includes the fight against microorganisms in the environment.\u00a0In the past, bacterial infections caused much mortality and morbidity to the human race.\u00a0With the development of antibiotics, this problem is now under control.\u00a0However, we are less successful in the development of effective anti-viral drugs.\u00a0Thus, viral infection has become a serious problem.\u00a0In this part, three viral infected diseases will be introduced.\u00a0These include influenza (caused by influenza virus), hepatitis B (caused by hepatitis B virus), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (caused by human immunodeficiency virus).  \u00a0  1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hepatitis B and liver cancer  \u00a0  In Hong Kong, it was estimated that about 10% of the whole population are hepatitis B carriers.\u00a0The long-term consequences of chronic viral hepatitis infection include liver cancer, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis.\u00a0Local studies showed that approximately 80% of patients with liver cancer were hepatitis B carriers.\u00a0In this module, the relationship between hepatitis B virus and liver diseases will be explored.  \u00a0  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Influenza  \u00a0  The annual epidemic and the potential threat of a pandemic render influenza a major infectious disease in the world.\u00a0Effective control of influenza entails a combination of good sanitary habits and the employment of effective vaccines, diagnostic tests and antiviral drugs.  \u00a0  3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HIV and AIDS  \u00a0  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\u00a0According to the statistics from the World Health Organization, AIDS accounts for the highest number of deaths in the world.\u00a0In this module, the structure and organization of HIV, the route of transmission of AIDS, as well as the diagnosis and therapy of AIDS will be discussed.  \u00a0 \u00a0 D.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growing old \u00a0 Aging is a natural process of all human beings.\u00a0Associated with aging, many physiological aspects of the body would start to deteriorate.\u00a0These include the deterioration of joint functions (which\u00a0will lead to arthritis), bone functions (which\u00a0will lead to the development of osteoporosis), and brain functions (which\u00a0will lead to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease).\u00a0The proper management of these conditions is a concern for\u00a0the aging population. \u00a0 \u00a0 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Arthritis \u00a0 Arthritis is a major burden of mobility for the elderly.\u00a0The development of arthritis is a multifactorial process.\u00a0This topic will introduce the basic science and the clinical treatment for the disease. \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Osteoporosis \u00a0 Osteoporosis is one of the most common health problems among the elderly, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissues leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk.\u00a0In this topic, the causes, preventive measurements and treatments of osteoporosis will be discussed. \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u00a0 The molecular basis of interneuron communication (neurotransmission) will be introduced.\u00a0Clinical signs and problems of the aged brain will be explained.\u00a0Advances in understanding and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease will be discussed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Course textbook Cohen BJ.

It is almost inevitable for people to have encountered individuals with unclear speech, hoarse voice, stuttering, autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment and dementia etc. in their lifetime. Students without a background in speech and hearing sciences may not have solid understanding of the essentials of human communication and its disorders. This course thus aims to provide tailor-made content suiting all students to cover the fundamentals of these topics from the perspective of speech-language-pathology. The course consists of 3 major components. The first one brings out the essential elements in normal communication. The second component covers what goes wrong in the chain of communication which leads to various communication disorders. The third component introduces various communication disorders in terms of the general characteristics and the practical tips on how to interact with them through case studies. By learning the essential elements of effective communication skills as well as gaining knowledge on how to facilitate interaction with people who have diverse communication and educational needs, this course also helps students to better understand the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relating to #3 Good Health and Well-being, #4 Inclusive Quality Education and #10 Reduced Inequalities.", "outcome": " Throughout the course, students will be able to achieve the following objectives through readings, lectures, team discussions, and group work: 1. Identify the various processes involved in successful human communication, including the basic anatomical, neurological, and physiological underpinnings of communication.

Explain how the breakdown in specific processes can lead to different communication disorders, including behavioral analyses. This will help promote SDG#4 - Quality Education by helping students understand how inclusive education is possible with different approaches. 3. Describe the communication, language, and speech characteristics of individuals with different communication disorders, promoting both SDG#4 - Quality Education and SDG#10 - Reduced Inequalities. 4. Summarize the basic principles of communicating with populations facing various difficulties, promoting empathy and diversity and aligning with SDG#4 and SDG#10. 5.

Students with SLI may encounter difficulties in communicating effectively with others, which may affect one\u2019s self-esteem and development of social relationships. They may have difficulties in understanding and / or giving oral presentations, struggle in following rapid verbal exchanges which may limit their participation in classes. They may also lack confidence in speaking in front of public or a large group of people. They may thus have trouble adapting to the course work and university life. This is partially attributable to the lack of awareness of SLI among university students and teachers.

This is followed by discussion on how physical concepts are embedded in everyday activities of living organisms such as movement, communication, hunting and navigation. As a closing remark, we will go beyond our own planet and discuss how the physical environment in other habitable exoplanets may shape potential lifeform. Through exploring the delicate interplay between lifeforms and the physical world, this course aims at looking at our living world from a new perspective and cultivating a sense of awe for nature.

The ultimate objective of this course is to help students develop a \u201ccomputational\u201d state of mind for everyday events. Specifically, the course will enable students to answer the following questions: What daily problems need to be solved by a computational method? Are such problems solvable? By what means can such problems be solved? Is it worthwhile to compute such problems? How do all these problems relate to the Internet that we use on a daily basis? We will also discuss intensively the societal impacts of computing technologies on our daily life. The course will be taught with minimal levels of mathematical and technical detail.Online lectures would be available for the whole course, making room for more in-depth learning in lecture sessions. Specifically, four to five lecture sessions would be conducted in collaborative workshop formats, whereby students need to work in teams to complete hands-on tasks corresponding to the topics covered in the course.

In order to make informed decisions as to whether we should adopt these ever-changing electronic technologies, we have to develop a basic understanding of the principles, \u201csubstances\u201d and cost-benefit considerations behind them. This course aims to: (i) arouse students\u2019 general interest in science and technology, particularly with regard to current \u201chigh-tech\u201d electronic products that they encounter every day; and (ii) enable students to develop critical intellectual enquiries concerning existing and latest electronic technologies they encounter in their everyday lives through lectures, discussions and hands-on experimentation. At the end of the course, students will not only be able to recognize how electronics works, but also be able to understand their social implications, as well as to develop critical thinking and to carry educated discussion about merits and common misconceptions associated with new technologies. The hands-on experiments will also allow the student to have the experience and some confidence in handling electronic components to solve a real problem using electronic technology.
