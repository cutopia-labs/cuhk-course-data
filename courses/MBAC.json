It emphasizes on several major topics related to executing a business opportunity and securing required financial resources. As the lack of financial resources is one of key failure factors and there are limited financial resources available to start-ups, students will be trained specifically for their fundraising skills. Since the investment community of Asia operates differently compared to the West, particularly USA, this course will concentrate on the assessment criteria of Asian investors in terms of the development and investment viability of ventures. This course covers critical issues concerning business ventures, especially ventures with innovative ideas and technology focuses, in detail. This course is highly practical in nature. Existing quality ventures that encounter problems in fundraising will be sourced through the Pan Asia Venture Development Platform (http://pavd.info/) globally.
