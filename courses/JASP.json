Students are expected to have gained a basic understanding of the structure of the Japanese language and historical changes of the writing system. Moreover, students will be able to understand the usage of the language, different styles and when each should be used, and different strategies used in expressing politeness.\u00a02. Students are expected to understand the relationship between the language expressions and the behaviors of Japanese people in various circumstances and the reasons behind such behaviors.\u00a03. Through comparing the culture of Japan with that of Hong Kong, students will become able to make comments on the characteristics of each and distinguish between the two.\u00a04.

The usage and the characteristics of Japanese language will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2\u00a0Lesson 2\u00a0Introduction to the historical changes of kanji and kana in the Japanese language:\u00a0This lesson explains the historical changes of kanji and kana in Japanese language. Focus will be on why Japanese absorbed Chinese characters into their writing system and the process of how Chinese characters were converted to the modern kana (hiragana and katakana).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3 \u2013 Week 4\u00a0Lesson 3\u00a0Introduction to the phrases expressing linguistic politeness:\u00a0This lesson briefly explains the phrases expressing linguistic politeness. These include honorific expressions, expressions used in making requests, making apologies, expressing gratitude and personal opinions, giving advice and asking for permission. Emphasis will be placed on when and how these expressions are used. The relationship between such expressions and the characteristics of hierarchy in Japanese society will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4 - 5\u00a0Lesson 4\u00a0Strategies used in making requests and refusals in Japanese: \u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese make requests and refuse the requests of others. Such expressions are often used in daily life by Japanese but are not easily understood by foreigners. Special attention will be given to: \u00a0a. the difference in behaviour between Japanese and non Japanese in making requests and refusals.\u00a0b. how this behaviour reflects characteristics of Japanese culture. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6 \u2013 Week 7\u00a0Lesson 5\u00a0Strategies used in making apologies and taking responsibility:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese apologize and take responsibility after misconduct such as scandals or accidents. For example, we often see the top management of Japanese companies bow to the public to apologize for their misconduct and they may even quit the company in order to take responsibility for problems. In Hong Kong, it is rare to see such a phenomenon. We will discuss the mechanism of how Japanese make an apology and the effect of the Japanese way of apologizing upon social situations. Special attention will be given to the comparison of the styles of apology in Japanese and Hong Kong societies. We will also discuss the relationship between the Japanese way of apologizing and issues related to the Sino-Japanese War.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 8 \u2013 Week 9\u00a0Lesson 6\u00a0Ambiguity in the Javanese language:\u00a0Compared with other languages such as Chinese, there are many ambiguous linguistic practices in Japanese. These include, for example, the deletion of the subject \"watashi\" (I), the use of \"koto ni\u00a0narimashita\" (become something) rather than \"koto ni shimashita\" (I decided to do something) when talking about personal matters such as getting married, and the frequent use of intransitive verbs rather than transitive verbs. Most Japanese language learners including Hong Kong learners have experienced difficulties with these expressions and practices in their learning process. We will analyze and comment on this phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9 \u2013 Week 10\u00a0Lesson 7\u00a0The Business Manner of Japanese:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese behave in business negotiations. Japanese are often criticized for not stating their true feelings and opinions. They often use expressions such as \"kangaesasetekudasai\" (Please let me think about it), \"kekkoo desu\" (It's O.K. /No, thank you) to indirectly express their opinions. We will discuss why Japanese behave in such a way and the correct way to deal with a Japanese business partner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10 - Week 11 \u00a0Lesson 8\u00a0Japanese language in a sociolinguistic perspective:\u00a0In this lesson we discuss the following items of importance in sociolinguistics as they appear in the Japanese language.\u00a0a. the comparison between written and colloquial styles\u00a0b. the comparison of language usage for men and women\u00a0c. the comparison between the standard language and dialect\u00a0d. the comparison of language usage between the young and the elderly\u00a0e. the comparison between formal styles and informal styles\u00a0f. the comparison between jargon and standard expressions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12\u00a0Lesson 9\u00a0The success and failure in learning Javanese language (with a focus on Hong Kong Cantonese speaking learners):\u00a0First, we will give a brief introduction to the theories of second language acquisition. Next, the factors affecting the results of the process of second language learning will be discussed. To ensure a better understanding, case studies comparing English language acquisition among Japanese and Hong Kong people will be introduced. Finally, by summarizing the above observations and the characteristics of both Japanese and Cantonese, we will comment on the difficulties experienced by Hong Kong Cantonese speaking Japanese learners.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13\u00a0Lesson 10\u00a0Special topics on Japanese 1anguage and Japanese culture: \u00a0Special topics will be selected to help students understand the relationship between Japanese language and culture.\u00a0a. \"shin go ryuukoogo taishoo\" (New words and buzz terms Grand Prix)\u00a0b. \"kotoshi no kanji\" (The Chinese character of this year)\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Lesson 1\u00a0Introduction to Japanese culture:\u00a01 Gottlieb, Nanette.

Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix.

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.", "syllabus": "Main Objective:This main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between Japan and Asia are by no means one-way traffic and Asia has been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\u00a0Key Issues and Problems:The following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\u00a01) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in Asia will be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary Japan. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\u00a0Core Content, Structure and Selected Topics:The course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture: (1) the application of cultural globalization theory in Japan, (2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries, (3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society.

Furthermore, it addresses the new challenges emerging within each of these spheres based on Japan\u2019s changing socio-economic and demographic landscapes.

Both sides frequently comment on the ways gender and gendered expectations shape and even determine contemporary experiences of \u201cbeing Japanese.\u201d Furthermore, stereotypes about gender and sexuality in Japan frequently overlap with and draw from broader stereotypes about Japan vis-\u00e0-vis other Asian societies and Asian societies vis-\u00e0-vis Western societies.By identifying these stereotypes and also critically questioning what gender means and how it is being shaped in and shaping contemporary Japan, this course will offer an entry into theories of gender studies and sexuality, and also introduce tools to critically analyze cultural differences manifested in the issues of gender and sexuality while at the same time learning more about Japanese society and your own society. Moving between historical and contemporary definitions of gender, sexuality, and family to look at change and continuity of gendered life ways in Japan, the course is divided into five sections addressing issues of: 1) Defining Gender and Gender Stereotypes; 2) Gender and Social Institutions; 3) Gender Construction / Performance; 4) The Politics of Sexuality and Identity; and 5) Gender and \u201cMarginality.\u201d In each section we investigate cultural constructions of gender, sexuality, and family and key themes that revolve around them: identity, class, morality and life course in contemporary Japan. At the end of each section we will take time to reflect on gender and sexuality in Asia more broadly. Class sessions will consist of lecture sessions devoted to explaining the readings in context and tutorial sections for facilitating active discussions and student presentations. Assignments for the course will ask students for active participation and weekly discussion questions, a reflective mid-term essay, and a final exam.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2600", "title": "Japanese Management", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Japanese Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course introduces the historical and social development of present Japanese management practices and systems.

Because of the success of Japanese economic development, Japanese management has become a unique and important field by itself. While Japanese management was much emulated in the 1980s and 1990s, it has also adapted and evolved according to chronological phases in its development. Changing Japanese economic needs, demographic shifts and evolving trends/lifestyles/habits seem to push Japanese management into a creative knowledge-based phase which is covered in the last section of this course. In the final analysis and in terms of application, one may develop comparative perspectives after taking this course, both internally within the different chronological phases of Japanese management as well as externally with other forms of management techniques.\u00a0This course introduces the historical and social development of present Japanese management practices and systems. It aims to equip students with better understanding of Japanese business people, to establish mutual understanding, and to help students learn to collaborate with staff from Japan so as to achieve common objectives.\u00a0The organization of the course is chronological starting from Japanese management\u2019s basic features to revisiting its sustained and continued applicability and finally to cutting edge contemporary ideas. It is a broad survey intended for class participants with no prior knowledge of management theories or Japanese studies beyond the usual terms encountered in the mass media and some acquisitions of new terminologies. It does not pretend to be comprehensive but gives participants a broad and foundational understanding of J-management augmented by selected case studies. It is broad and foundational in the sense that the course can be divided into three phases from the basic features to recent case studies and then to the nuts and bolts of contemporary ideas. \u00a0\u00a0Chinese course description:\u00a0\u672c\u79d1\u76ee\u900f\u904e\u65e5\u672c\u793e\u6703\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u4ecb\u7d39\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u5b78\u7684\u6b74\u53f2\u3002\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u6607\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u65bc\u65e5\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u54e1\u7684\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u8b00\u6c42\u8207\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5efa\u7acb\u4e92\u76f8\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e92\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e92\u76f8\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u9054\u6210\u5171\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u00a0\u00a0Course schedule\u00a0=============================================================\u00a0Week 1: Basic concepts of Japanese management\u00a0Lecture: \u00a0Mandatory Reading: \u00a0(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 2 Human Resource Management\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 13-30 (17 pages)\u00a0(2) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 4 Knowledge Management\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 39-52 (13 pages)\u00a0\u00a0Tutorial:\u00a0The first tutorial will go through the requirements of the course. ================================================================\u00a0Week 2: Basic concepts of Japanese management \u00a0Lecture \u00a0Mandatory Reading:\u00a0(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 5 Entering the Japanese Market\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 55-74 (19 pages) \u00a0\u00a0Tutorial:\u00a0Class participants will work in groups to discuss their understanding of the readings and learn to adopt the perspective of their training, expertise and interest to analyze the readings, ask questions and discuss it in the context of their research interests.\u00a0=======================================================================\u00a0Week 3: \u00a0Lecture:\u00a0Mandatory Reading:\u00a0(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 6 Succeeding as Foreign Manager in a Japanese Firm\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 75-90 (15 pages)\u00a0(2) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 7 Intercultural Challenges when Working in Japan\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 91-106 (15 pages)\u00a0 \u00a0Tutorial: \u00a0It plans to discuss early in the course broad strategies to tackle the short essay and build on essay writing skills learnt in other modules and courses, discussing thesis statement writing skills and question writing skills for the purpose of enhancing essay writing skills.

Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular \u201cpopularly massified\u201d socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the \u201cculture industry\u201d in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization. These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3500", "title": "World War Two on Japanese, Chinese and American Screens", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Japanese Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course aims to explore the possible motivations and political backgrounds underlying the production of films that are related to WWII in East Asia, following the end of the Cold War, that is, during and after the 1990s. The intention is to analyze whether the demise of the Cold War has provided a more favorable time for Japan, China and the US to re-examine WWII in a fresh light. The year 1990 marks a watershed for geopolitics. In that immediately prior to and after 1990, the world witnessed many historical events still thought of as the most significant in recent history, even today. Such events as regards East Asia include the Tiananmen Incident, the burst of Japan\u2019s bubble economy, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise of China. Security concerns among China, Japan and the US changed following 1990 in that Russia is no longer thought of as being a common threat of such primary importance as was the case with its predecessor state, the USSR. There is today a renewed sense of nationalistic assertiveness that can be seen in disputes in and amongst Japan, China and the US over history, territories, military expansion and in conflict over trade between these economic giants. At the same time, in the last twenty years, there have been frequent productions of movies related to WWII in East Asia, on events where differing views of history cause controversy, such as the Nanjing Massacre, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. There is therefore importance in investigating to what extent these movies are a reflection of such nationalistic sentiment, as well as the extent to which the WWII theme in filmmaking for a popular market is a tool for groups harboring specific political and ideological agendas. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. Students are required to choose a related topic at the beginning of the course and present his/her ideas in the last two lessons.

Japan\u2019s peripheral geographic location made it possible for gradual changes to occur based on its own internal needs. Except for the postwar reform, most Japanese innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure from foreign countries.This course explores how the Yamato nation and the Japanese language were formed based on hypotheses in related fields. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be dealt with from a cultural historical point of view. Attempts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the past centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform. The course also discusses how these reforms influence modern Japan society.", "outcome": "1. to develop a proper understanding of Japanese culture from a cultural historical point of view;\u00a02. to properly articulate different topics with relevant historical contexts of Japan;\u00a03. to critically examine popular and yet controversial theories and/or perceptive frameworks for analyzing Japanese culture; and\u00a04. to understand the specificity and universality of Japanese culture.", "syllabus": "1.

In what ways do capitalist economies differ from one another in their social organization, institutional embeddedness, gendered relations, and modes of governance? What are the challenges of such differences for management and economic performance in a competitive global economy? How have Japanese corporations responded to the processes of globalization and neoliberalization? In tackling these questions, we will analyze the issues of industrialization, globalization and neoliberalism as well as a broad range of topics, including those related to labor, industrial organization, the theory of the firm, management, gender, and economic reforms in Japanese society.

Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization.These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5624", "title": "Japanese Language and Society", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Japanese Studies", "requirements": "For students of MPhil-PhD Japanese Studies & MA Japanese Studies\nExclusion = JASP3700", "description": "This course explores both linguistic structures and sociolinguistic features of the Japanese language.
