We start with the classical protein folding experiments of Anfinsen who lead to the Nobel Prize in 1972, to the latest research on protein folding energetics. The students are challenged with open-end questions on how to address key questions on energetic factors that contribute to protein stability. Through intensive in-class discussions and quizzes, the students will learn how hypotheses on protein folding are supported or disproved by experimental evidence. Examples also include those published by scientists in Hong Kong so that the students have a more personal touch on how scientists innovate and design their researches.\u00a0Stage 2: Learn how to apply the theories learnt to improve protein stability in a group project.\u00a0The students are divided into small groups and work together on a group project to study how to improve protein stability using the theory of protein folding energetic learnt.
