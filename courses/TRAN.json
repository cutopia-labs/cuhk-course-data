Students will be instructed in the processes of correcting and revising the output of machine-generated translation in order to meet a standard comparable to that of a human translator (or other more specific quality criteria). Machine translation can process a large amount of data much faster than traditional translation, so in order to save time and money, translation companies are increasingly turning to machine translation technology. This output, while more accurate than ever, still requires editing. Post-editing therefore represents the future of the global translation industry; a future in which most text types will be translated by machine translation tools, then edited by trained post-editors. As such, post-editing skills are highly sought after by language service providers.The course will first offer an introduction to the theory of machine translation alongside the evaluation of machine translation quality and effectiveness. Specialist software will be utilised to compare a range of machine translation engines, helping students to understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine translation. Students will then be introduced to the post-editing of machine translation, including various editing strategies designed to improve the raw output of machine translation software (light edit, full edit, etc.). This will help students to appreciate the requirements of professional post-editing tasks and workflows in the global translation industry.The language pairs used in this course will be Chinese to English and English to Chinese. This course is designed as a companion course to TRAN6601 Introduction to Computer-aided Translation, as such, knowledge of computer-aided translation software would be beneficial but is not a prerequisite.The course will be divided into two main components: Machine translation. First, we will take a simple and mostly non-technical look at how machine translation operates, from statistical machine translation to neural machine translation. The various pros and cons of machine translation will be considered, alongside discussion of which text types are most suitable for MT and what kinds of common mistakes the post-editor should look out for. Editing. We will start by discussing the pre-editing of machine translation, which involves preparing a text for translation by following certain stylistic or terminological guidelines in an effort to improve the quality of the output. Post-editing techniques such as \u201clight\u201d post-editing (making a text understandable) and \u201cheavy\u201d post-editing (increasing quality to a publishable standard) will be discussed and practiced. Different genres and text-types will be handled during class practice and in assignments, as well as strategies for tackling larger projects. Students will be expected to complete a group project that requires working as a team to produce a longform post-edited translation and present their findings in class.
