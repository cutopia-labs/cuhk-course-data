People are not satisfied with merely algorithmic associations but want to know the meanings, emotions, sensibility, and identities behind data. Qualitative methods in gender studies capacitate us to engage in deep reflection about the process, dynamics, and the deeper structure of the social world to come up with a better solution to many problems of inequality.

This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3010", "title": "Being Trans: Understanding Transgender Lives in the Here and Now", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Gender Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "This course is one of the first courses dedicated to understanding trans-ness and trans-hood grounded in lived transgender experience in the East-Asian, especially the Sinophone, context. Conceptualised and co-taught by a trans person, the course adopts a holistic life approach, informed by first hand trans-perspective, in examining different aspects of our cis-hetero-patriarchal society (among many other exclusionary structures such as ableism, racism, ageism, etc.) through trans encounters in the everyday. Starting with tracing the evolution of terms in relation to the transgender identity, the exploration would be followed by reflections of the origin of the idea of \u201ctrans\u201d, namely that of transgression and crossing-over, as an act of going beyond binaries. When inspecting gender frameworks in the \u201cnon-West\u201d, especially those of formerly colonized societies, we can see how different understandings and imaginations of sex, gender, and sexuality would yield very different identifications, and thus human possibilities. Following more conceptual reflections, the second part of the course would be focused on societal structures as lived trans experiences, ranging from more social topics such as design and access of public facilities, the omnipresence of gender as identifier in everyday spaces and institutions, legal struggle for rights and recognition, to more intimate ones such as natal family ties, romantic relationship, sexual explorations and expressions, and reproductive experiments.The final part of the course would be an exploration beyond, reaching out to situate transgender issues within a larger context of other movements for progress and equal rights. Drawing from his experience as the city\u2019s most prominent trans activist and a transgender support group organizer for over a decade, the instructor will be guiding the students in a critical examination of important debates within and outside of the transgender and the extended queer community, inspecting in-depth the simultaneous solidarity and tensions among different groups, from the increasing polarization and politicization of different interpretations of Feminism, to questioning the \u201cimagined community\u201d of LGBTQIA+ comradeship in HK and abroad, reflecting on the standing of transgender persons and transgender issues in the here and now.  The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different aspects, discourses, and phenomenon related to trans identities and their life experiences.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0State the key issues, concepts, and developments in the field of transgender studies;2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Distinguish the competing theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding and defining different gender identities;3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Understand the notion of transgender in a cross-cultural perspective;4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Recognize that other factors such as social class, sexuality, race/ethnicity and age cut across the issues pertinent to transgender studies;5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Comment on the pros and cons of various understandings and definitions of transgender;6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Theorize contemporary social issues in relation to transgender identities;7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Critically engage with inequality and violence in society in relation to different modes and notions of gender, especially in relation to transgender people.\u00a0", "syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction to Transgender Studies: Evolution of terms, identities, and understandings of \u201ctransgender\u201dWeek 2: Beyond the Binary: Understanding \u201ctransgender\u201d in the non-WestWeek 3: Experiencing Gender in the Everyday (1): Reflections on gendered systems and spaces\u00a0Week 4: Experiencing Gender in the Everyday (2): Family and relationshipsWeek 5: Transgender as a Legal Matter: The Hong Kong journey\u00a0Week 6: Dancing with the Medical System (1): Transgender as \u201cdisability\u201d, pathologization, and other discussions about medicalization\u00a0Week 7: Dancing with the Medical System (2): Navigating the system and imagining different physical possibilities\u00a0Week 8: Living Trans Bodies (1): Transgender in Sports - Reflections about gender as category, inherent biases, (mis)knowledge, and the fear of unfairnessWeek 9: Living Trans Bodies (2): The Unimaginable - Male menstruation, trans men pregnancy, chest-feeding, and the right to reproductionWeek 10: Living Trans Bodies (3): Trans Sexuality and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Week 11: Trans Masculinity (vs) Trans Femininity.. and what about Non-Binary?: Imaging manhood, womanhood, and beyond from a trans perspective\u00a0Week 12: Imagining Trans-hood: Visibility, representation, and trans possibilities in popular cultureWeek 13: Imagined Community: Placing the T among the LGBQIA+, Feminists, and other movementsWeek 14: Conclusion: Intersectionality, self-declaration, trans youth, de-transition, and other debates", "required_readings": "Primary Text\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stryker Susan and Stephen Whittle. 2013.

In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of \u2018collective memory\u2019 of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " It is anticipated that on completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 identify major areas and topics regarding the study of women\u2019s lives and experiences in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 analyse and discuss in what ways gender has been an organizing force in shaping families, professions, education, and social movements in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine one\u2019s self identity in complex historical and social contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evaluate competing narratives of a \u2018Hong Kong Story\u2019 from a gender and historical perspective  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apply first-hand knowledge and skills in writing history relating the personal to the social, cultural, political and economic contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 recognize the interconnections between different sources of inequality and oppression \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0critically engage with notions of social justice and social transformation  \u00a0  \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0A\u00a0 INTRODUCTION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Introduction: Revisiting Hong Kong\u2019s history (1840s -1990s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Methodology: Narrative, Auto/biography and Oral HistoryB\u00a0 WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: Servitude, Lineage, and Family Networks in pre-war Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Protected Women, san po tsai, mui tsai and concubines \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 Village women and boat women\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Merchants\u2019 daughters: women in the elite families \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C\u00a0 WOMEN AND FEMALE EDUCATION : From Protection to Modernisation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 European missionaries and nuns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 Local headmistresses and teachers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 Girls going to school and universityD\u00a0 WOMEN AT WORK: Gender, Work and Professions\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 Brothel keepers and prostitutes in the 19th Century\u00a0\u00a0 10 Nurses and doctors (1920s-1980s)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 11 Factory workers (1960s-1990s)\u00a0E\u00a0 WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM (1910s-1970s): Public Voice for the Private Sphere\u00a0\u00a0 12 Leaders of the anti-mui tsai campaign, the campaign against licensed prostitution, the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YWCA and the Family Planning Association", "required_readings": "Primary SourcesSelected documents from archives of mission societies, girls\u2019 schools, and charities.Published Secondary SourcesHong Kong History and Women\u2019s HistoryNgo, Tak-wing (ed.)

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives.

Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues.

In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words.

Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women\u2019s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts.

This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media.

How do we understand the notion of \u201cminority\u201d? And how does \u201cminority\u201d, look like, in cinema? This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning \u201cminority\u201d identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of \u201cminority\u201d, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct \u201cthe Other\u201d in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social \u201cminorities\u201d affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object \u201cin films cut to the measure of desire\u201d of the dominant social groups.What happens when \u201cminority\u201d artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by \u201cminority\u201d filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo.

This paradoxical nature, coupled with the fact that we cannot not communicate, makes our interpersonal lives moderately challenging and, more often than not, a source of joy, fulfillment, and connection, as well as frustration, unhappiness, and even conflict. In the 1960s, having witnessed humanity's capacity for both violence and care, clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg sought to develop Compassionate communication (also known as Nonviolent communication) to foster love, truth, and courage. This model enables people to stay connected with themselves and others by identifying and expressing their underlying basic needs, even during times of conflict. Not only does Compassionate communication nurture connection, but it also provides various tools to shift the mode of influence from power-over to power-with in collaborative settings, contributing to a peaceful and inclusive future. In fact, Compassionate communication has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the best practices for nonviolent conflict resolution in both formal and informal education worldwide. As working with people from diverse backgrounds becomes increasingly common, the ability to communicate across differences is essential. This course will cover all the essential concepts, processes, and skills of Compassionate communication for both personal and social life. Through interactive learning in the form of role plays, demonstrations, and real-life scenarios, the course will cultivate students' awareness of their needs and their ability to authentically express themselves. Students will learn to listen with empathy, make life-enriching requests, apologize without self-blame, navigate conflict, hold difficult conversations, and facilitate collaboration across differences.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will acquire1. A deepened understanding of the underlying premises, processes, concepts and skills of Compassionate Communication.2. An increased capacity to experience, identify and respond to the own emotions and feelings, as well as those of others.3. Confidence and ease in authentic self-expression with care, orienting to others\u2019 experiences with empathy, making life-enriching requests without demands, and navigating difficult conversations and conflicts with a collaborative mindset.4. Openness and curiosity toward differences, along with a skill set for collaborating with people from various backgrounds.", "syllabus": "CLASS 1:\u00a0The Basics of Compassionate Communication (I)This lecture introduces how and why clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg developed Compassionate Communication (also known as Nonviolent Communication, NVC) in the 1960s and outlines its key premises. It contrasts three common types of communication\u2014 dialogue, debate, and persuasion\u2014and characterises Compassionate Communication as a language modality that fosters dialogue. Additionally, it identifies four common language patterns that hinder connection and understanding.CLASS 2:\u00a0The Basics of Compassionate Communication (II)There are four components of Compassionate Communication that enhance connection and clarity: observation, feelings, needs, and requests. This session will guide students in making clear distinctions between observations and evaluations, feelings and thoughts, needs and strategies, and requests and demands. Additionally, it will help students cultivate their \u201cneeds consciousness\u201d, serving as a foundation for empathetic listening.CLASS 3:\u00a0The Power of Empathetic ListeningEmpathetic listening goes beyond the mechanics of hearing words; it involves immersing oneself in the speaker's emotional landscape, understanding their feelings and needs, and responding with genuine care and understanding. In this session, participants will learn to distinguish empathetic from non-empathetic responses listening, and the power of empathetic listening in transforming conflict to connection.CLASS 4:\u00a0Practicing Empathetic ListeningTuning into the inner world of another person is a skill that requires refinement through repeated practice. This session will provide students with four easy-to-follow frameworks for listening to others with empathy. It will also offer important advice on making empathetic guesses more colloquial and natural in daily conversations. In empathetic responses, we often ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of the other person's experience. This session will distinguish between the types of questions that strengthen connection and those that do not.CLASS 5:\u00a0Making Life-Fulfilling RequestsThis week's topic focuses on making requests in Compassionate Communication, highlighting our interdependence in meeting needs through others. While making requests can feel daunting, the course examines how they invite contributions to our happiness and addresses challenges like fear of rejection and underestimating others' willingness to comply. We will explore barriers to making fulfilling requests and share strategies for clear communication to improve positive responses. The session will also cover handling unmet requests and understanding the needs behind a \"no.\" The goal is to help participants feel more comfortable asking for what they need while remaining open to any outcome.CLASS 6:\u00a0Expressing Appreciation and Making Apologies Without Self-BlameExpressing appreciation is often recommended by relationship coaches as a relational lubricant. However, through the lens of Compassionate Communication, our usual way of expressing appreciation can sometimes take the form of judgment, even if it\u2019s positive. The issue with judgment\u2014positive or negative\u2014is its static language, which can cast others, and even ourselves, in stone. For example, saying \u201cYou are so generous\u201d provides no context about what actions led to that acknowledgement or which needs were met. Similarly, apologies like \u201cI\u2019m wrong\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can also be seen as judgments that foster self-blame and diminish self-confidence. This lecture will explore how to express appreciation using action-oriented language and how to make apologies without self-blame while fully acknowledging our impact on others.CLASS 7:\u00a0Troubleshooting: Clearing What Stands in the Way of Using Compassionate Communication\u00a0Failure teaches success. In this lesson, we will address frequently asked questions and common pitfalls encountered on the journey of learning and practising Compassionate Communication. Understanding the challenges we face can transform setbacks into valuable learning experiences. We encourage you to engage actively by asking any questions related to communication and its daily-life applications. Together, we\u2019ll explore strategies to navigate these challenges, enhancing both your understanding and practical skills in Compassionate Communication. Your inquiries will help deepen our discussion and foster a supportive learning environment.CLASS 8:\u00a0Navigating Cultural Differences in Communication StylesThis week\u2019s topic explores the intersection of culture and emotions within Compassionate Communication. We\u2019ll examine how cultural backgrounds shape perceptions, expressions, and management of emotions, focusing on the differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. This session will discuss how cultures define ideal emotions, prioritise emotional expression or suppression, and the impact on mental and physical health. Additionally, we will consider how cultural perspectives influence emotional interpretation, whether through individual expression or situational context. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance our awareness of how culture affects emotional experiences and apply this understanding to our Compassionate Communication practice.CLASS 9:\u00a0Dancing with Conflict (I): What and Why?Conflict is an inevitable part of life, and while it can be intense and overwhelming, it also presents opportunities for growth and understanding. This week, we begin our exploration of conflict through the lens of Compassionate Communication. We will start by examining our own typical reactions to conflict and identifying our default modes of engagement. We will discuss how conflict arises from differing needs, values, and interpretations of situations, and how these differences can be opportunities to learn from each other. This lecture introduces the idea that all actions, including those that trigger conflict, are attempts to meet basic human needs. By understanding the underlying needs and values involved, we can begin to shift from blame and judgment to connection and resolution.CLASS 10:\u00a0Dancing with Conflict (II): 9 Skills to Navigate ConflictBuilding on our understanding of conflict, this week we will explore the practical application of the \"9 Skills\" of Compassionate Communication developed by Jim and Jori Manske. These skills offer a framework for effectively navigating conflict, beginning with the vital \"Zero Step\" of being present and self-connected. We will emphasise the importance of self-empathy in managing reactions and remaining grounded. The lecture will cover inviting others into dialogue, creating a safe space, expressing ourselves honestly, listening with empathy, making clear requests, and acknowledging different perspectives. We will also discuss using gratitude, feedback, and confirmation to enhance communication and understanding. By applying these skills to past conflicts, we aim to build stronger relationships and navigate difficult conversations. Ultimately, the focus will be on gaining confidence in using these skills in daily life for more compassionate and effective interactions.CLASS 11:\u00a0How to Have Difficult Conversations?We will explore four responses to disagreements: 1) blaming others, 2) blaming ourselves, 3) practising self-empathy, and 4) empathising with others. Each response will be detailed, and practical exercises will reinforce our understanding. We will also identify factors that contribute to challenging conversations, such as differences in positional and status power. Additionally, we will analyse the impact of holding an \"Enemy Image\" of others and how to transform this perspective through Compassionate Communication principles. Intimate relationships can bring both joy and pain, often prompting us to recreate bonds we had with caregivers or compensate for unmet needs. In these relationships, we learn to express our needs while respecting our partner's boundaries. This session will provide valuable tips from Compassionate Communication for every stage of romance\u2014whether it\u2019s attraction, navigating power struggles, commitment, or even breaking up. By understanding our responses and improving our communication skills, we can foster healthier, more fulfilling relationships.CLASS 12:\u00a0Collaborating Across Differences: Compassionate Communication for Team WorkCollaboration is widely regarded as an essential means and a long-cherished goal across various settings. In this session, we will explore the roles and types of facilitation, along with practical facilitation skills to enhance our collaborative efforts. We will guide you through the process of designing a meeting, including setting a clear purpose and desired outcomes, as well as selecting appropriate processes. Additionally, we will have a brief discussion on alternative decision-making systems beyond majority rule, which are more likely to address basic needs without creating opposition.CLASS 13:\u00a0Harvesting Co-Learning Experience\u00a0", "required_readings": "CLASS 1:\u00a0The Basics of Compassionate Communication (I)Marshall Rosenberg, \u201cCommunication that Blocks Compassion,\u201d in Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life, 3rd Edition (Encinitas, CA: PuddleDancer Press, 2015), 15-24.Miki Kashtan, \u201cNonviolent Communication as Practice,\u201d in Spinning Threads of Radical Aliveness: Transcending the Legacy of Separation in Our Individual Lives (Oakland, CA.: Fearless Heart Publications, 2014), 369-375.CLASS 2:\u00a0The Basics of Compassionate Communication (II)Marshall B.

We will look at Filipina, Vietnamese and Chinese women migrating to Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States for marriage and employment. We will discuss issues related to labor and marriage migrations, as well as trafficking in women, on both macro- and micro-levels. We are going to ask: how does the global economic restructuring shape the gendered migration today? What makes female labor different from male labor in the global labor market? What are push-and-pull factors that trigger these women to leave their hometown to be workers or wives in foreign countries? What difficulties do they experience after entering host societies and what impact would the migration flow bring to both laborer/bride receiving and sending countries? Moreover, we will explore the global market formation of transnational commodified marriages between women from developing countries and men from more developed countries. Taking the matchmaking industry in Taiwan and Vietnam for example, we will ask: how should we perceive the subjectivity of women who marry abroad through brokers? How could we challenge the assumption that the brokerage business in transnational marriage is part of human trafficking practice, and women involved in this activity are victims? To better address this issue, we may also need to address the question: what is trafficking in women? How are women represented in the global anti-trafficking campaign and how the politics of charity influences the state\u2019s immigration policymaking and women\u2019s transnational mobility? We will approach these issues from a critical perspective in order to challenge given social perception that ignores women's agency at work. Throughout the semester, we will read theoretical and empirical works from many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, political economy and women's studies.

As a discipline, gender studies draws on a variety of knowledge in humanities and social science and shapes its methodology and methods to challenge existing hegemonic knowledge that is considered being produced scientifically. The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critical questioning of the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration. To make sure students are capable of conducting their own research using a feminist framework, this course also requests students to conduct a mini study and engage in narrative analyses. After taking this course, students are expected to be familiar with feminist approaches of conducting research and able to reflect on the knowledge production of their own research in the future.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5030", "title": "Advanced Topics in Gender Studies I", "career": "Postgraduate - Research", "units": "1.50", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Seminar", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Gender Studies", "requirements": "For students in MA Gender Studies, MPhil Gender Studies, PhD Gender Studies, MPhil-PhD Gender Studies", "description": "This seminar aims at engaging students in the most current researches in gender studies, providing them with intellectual stimulation and support for the preparation of the M.Phil./ Ph.D. thesis.

Why does gender matter in shaping the experience of work? Beginning with these questions, this course explores the distinct positions of men and women in the workplace and in the labor markets and examines gender relationship, gender segregation and gender discrimination across a variety of research topics on farm work, factory work, migrant work, business, housework, service work, entertainment and leisure. We will be reading about, analyzing, and discussing diverse empirical studies on men and women as workers, homemakers, care workers, organizers, or entrepreneurs, which provide fresh ways to look at the relationship between gender and work. This course provides students with key concepts and theories about the gendered institutions of economic development, organization, migration, and culture. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker and educated reader of social issues from a gender perspective. Students are expected to acquire critical thinking and analytical skills to reflect on theories and research findings, and to evaluate social facts and trends with implications for education, policy interventions and public participation.

Students will be introduced to a variety of issues related to work in general - what it means to work, what issues individuals face in finding and keeping jobs, and why people do or do not succeed in the workplace;\u00a04.
