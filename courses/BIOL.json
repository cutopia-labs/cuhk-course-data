Chemistry and physics of cell membrane and its mechanism of communications and transportation; 3. Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton in intracellular structuring and trafficking; and 4. Mechanisms of signal transduction in cell proliferation and programmed cell death. As the final capstone module of this course, the significance of cell biology in understanding and improving human health and disease will be discussed. Clinical researchers may be invited to share their innovative research design and findings and to inspire our students about the importance of basic discoveries in applied studies.Topics 1-8 introduce students our current understanding about the structures, functions and mechanisms of a number of components in a eukaryotic cell and illustrate how these components interact, leading to cell proliferation and programmed cell death. The final capstone topic \u201cClinical Application of Cell Biology\u201d inspires the students about how they can apply what they have learned in the previous topics, seemingly fundamental and discrete, in an integrative manner for understanding and improving human health and diseases. This capstone topic will also stimulate the students to think out of the box and realize the significance of basic research in applied studies.Senior Student Mentorship Programme (SSMP) is implemented in this course so that the hundreds of students will be assigned into groups, mentoring by some selected senior students, who have taken this course before with good academic results. Besides sharing their learning experiences and answering their mentees\u2019 questions about cell biology, these senior students, who are mostly engaging in experimental projects in their capstone courses, can also inspire their mentees about the innovation and design of their scientific studies.

The community ecology component will focus on factors that determine the structure and function of biological communities, including nutrient cycles and biogeochemistry.

The course begins with an introduction of the history and philosophy of evolutionary ideas, followed by the genetics of adaptation, natural selection and speciation, and then on to the geological record and the fossil record of origination and extinction, and finishes with a morphology-focussed discussion of phylogenetics and the molecular basis of evolution. Case studies on the use of different data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including dinosaur evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a project will be initiated by students based on their own interests that will be completed by searching for and synthesising ideas and knowledge from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a lab practical is organized so students can apply what they have learnt in class. Students will also be quizzed during tutorials about course sections and project work.

It will focus on different cutting edge genomic approaches and technologies, with the aim to let students develop critical thinking skills to solve biological problems using these molecular tools and methods.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4032", "title": "Physiological Investigations", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "2.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Laboratory\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Biology Pgm Comm", "requirements": "Co-requisite: BIOL3530 or 3630.", "description": "This course let students learn some key physiological phenomena in both plants and animals through experiments.
