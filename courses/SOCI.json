Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from \u201cthe last Colony\u201d of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called \u2018Hong Kong identity\u2019. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)", "outcome": "        \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u671f\u671b\u9054\u5230\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e94\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c:  \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b, \u4ee5\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7684\u8996\u91ce\u53bb\u5e6b\u52a9\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u6230\u5f8c\u7d93\u6b77\u904e\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u767c\u5c55, \u653f\u6cbb\u8b8a\u5316, \u53ca\u6587\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u885d\u64ca\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u53ca\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u4e86\u89e3;  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u80fd\u5920\u5168\u9762\u601d\u8003\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703, \u7d93\u6fdf\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff, \u4e26\u660e\u767d\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u69cb\u80cc\u6240\u6d89\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\u8207\u7fa9\u52d9, \u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u8207\u7d93\u6fdf\u8cc7\u6e90\u5206\u914d.  \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 (social change) \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u8a0e\u8ad6\u8eab\u4efd. \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u660e\u767d\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u9019\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u904e\u53bb\u534a\u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u793e\u6703\u6539\u8b8a, \u5305\u62ec\u672c\u571f\u5316, \u53bb\u5de5\u696d\u5316, \u7d93\u6fdf\u8f49\u578b, \u5168\u7403\u5316, \u65b0\u4e2d\u7522\u968e\u7d1a\u7684\u8208\u8d77, \u4e3b\u6b0a\u79fb\u4ea4\u7b49\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.  \u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u5b8f\u89c0\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u4e86\u89e3 \u2018\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u2019 \u9019\u500b\u8eab\u4efd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703\u7d50\u69cb (social structure) \u8207\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff; \u4e26\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u601d\u8003\u2018\u500b\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u2019 (individual identity)\u8207\u7fa4\u9ad4 (groups), \u793e\u5340(communities), \u793e\u6703\u7cfb\u7d71, (systems), \u548c\u5236\u5ea6 (institutions) \u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u900f\u904e\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f, \u5305\u62ec\u5609\u8cd3\u8b1b\u8005,\u591a\u5a92\u9ad4\u5f71\u97f3\u6559\u6750\u64ad\u653e\u53ca\u8a0e\u8ad6, \u548c\u5c0f\u7d44\u5c08\u984c\u7fd2\u4f5c \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2, \u7d50\u69cb, \u6587\u5316\u548c\u5728\u9019\u500b\u793e\u6703\u88e1\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u7fa4\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3, \u4ea6\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u4ee5\u8f03\u5168\u9762\u5b8f\u89c0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u601d\u8003\u554f\u984c.

Is inequality an inevitable feature of human life? (b) How many social classes are there? What are the principal? \"fault lines\" or social cleavages that define the class structure? Are these cleavages strengthening or weakening with the transition to advanced industrialism? (c) How frequently do individuals cross occupational or class boundaries? Are educational degrees, social contacts, and \"individual luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions? What other social and institutional forces affect occupational attainment and allocation? (d) How are the lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities of individuals shaped by their class locations? Are there identifiable \"class cultures\" in past and present societies? (e) What types of social processes and state policies serve to maintain or alter racial, ethnic, and sex discrimination in labor markets? Have these forms of discrimination weakened or strengthened with the transition to advanced industrialism? (f) Will stratification systems take on new and distinctive forms in the future? Is a \"new class\" of professionals and intellectuals emerging?

From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic.

The course begins by introducing various concepts of social control from a sociological standpoint. In addition to a review of the relevant criminological theories and empirical research findings, the course assesses the major impact of globalization on public security and explores the proliferation of transnational criminal activities in the process. Finally, the course will examine how social control agencies react and seek to address these problems in local and global context.", "outcome": "By the end of the course, the students are expected to: have acquired a good knowledge on how criminological theories can help them to understand the relationship between crime and social control understand the risks and challenges posed to public security in different societies by the process of globalization  recognize how some social control measures are conducted locally and in overseas to combat against crimes be able to apply sociological perspectives and insights to review and assess the effectiveness of social control measures in different jurisdictions", "syllabus": "Week 1Introduction: Theoretical Approaches to Social ControlRequired Readings:Chriss, J.

Through in-depth case studies of exemplary empirical studies based on randomized experimental/quasi-experimental designs, the course will demonstrate how basic research could help understand human attitudes/perceptions/behaviors and provide evidence-based guidance for policymaking.This course is intended for students in their third or fourth year of college. The course coverage will be helpful to students who intend to pursue more advanced academic training, government sector jobs that place a premium on program evaluation and quantitative literacy, or service industry jobs that have witnessed a surging demand for big data applications. A one-term course on basic statistics is essential for understanding the technical but elementary terms used in this course. Still, math and statistical skills are not required to excel in this course.Specifically, the course is designed to achieve three learning objectives:1. To master the generalized experimental methodology by studying the core principles of experimental designs and some exemplary social science experimental studies. 2. To ask real-world questions that can be answered with randomized experiments (of various forms) to understand human perceptions/behaviors, induce behavioral changes, and inform evidence-based policymaking.3. To gain intuitive understanding of the counterfactual paradigm for causal thinking (i.e., using quasi-experimental designs) when truly randomized experiments are infeasible.Evaluation of learning progress and performance will closely align with the course objectives. The course assessments would emphasize the conceptual and empirical understandings of experimental designs and their real-world applications through a group project presentation and a short research proposal written by individuals.

However, we now have a better understanding of the social causes and consequences of these issues through years of empirical research and studies, hence with potential ways to achieve more sustainable housing. This course examines housing from a broad social science perspective while providing students with a solid foundation in the sociological understanding of housing. The course begins with a review of the literature, exploring the political economy of housing production and consumption. Key topics include: An examination of the various agents involved in the housing market, including tenants, landlords, urban planners, and developers. Reflections on the social construction of the meaning of housing and its implications for individuals and communities. A discussion on the financialization of the housing market and the unequal accessibility of mortgage credits, which shape life chances and create new forms of inequality in urban centers. The impact of living in substandard housing on health and psychological well-being. Issues of housing segregation along ethnic and racial lines, gentrification, displacement, and homelessness.

Students will interact with local scholars/university students and/or community members, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and collaborative learning experiences. A study trip to a selected destination outside of Hong Kong will take place during term breaks, providing immersive experiences in the field. Students will be required to engage actively in all course activities, including lectures, workshops, and field studies. The assessment will include individual and group-based assignments, culminating in a reflective report that integrates their field experiences with sociological theories. By the end of the course, students will have developed practical skills in sociological research and analysis, enhancing their capacity to engage meaningfully with global social issues and contributing to their growth as informed global citizens.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3451", "title": "Selected Topics in Sociology I", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Sociology", "requirements": "-", "description": "The content of the course will vary with the instructor.
