These converters must strictly meet grid standards, before they can connect and channel renewable energy to the grids. They sometimes also have to perform certain grid-friendly functions, such as fault ride-through and power-quality enhancement. It is thus essential to understand a usable power converter and the grid standards governing it. For the former, topics proposed for the course include its modulation and control, in addition to a discussion of some classical and modern topologies. In terms of modulation, the targets are to minimize harmonics, common-mode voltages and others, and for control, the challenges are to ensure precise tracking, stability, and fast dynamics. An appropriately modulated and controlled power converter can then be fine-tuned to meet grid standards for various grid-related applications. These applications may additionally require components like phase-locked loops and high-order filters, which are hence also discussed in the course. Some example applications, ranged from a low-power single-phase photovoltaic converter to a high-power microgrid converter, are then analysed before concluding the course.
