NormanDesign thinking creates value through systematic innovation. The objective of this course is to enable students to apply design thinking to create social value through systematic social innovation. To elaborate, this course introduces students to design thinking theories, methods and skills and their applications in the context of social innovation. Design thinking is an increasingly important concept needed for an effective implementation of ideas. It supports development of human-centric solutions, and uses a design-based mindset to provide practical solutions to complex problems. According to Soule, Malhota and Clavier, social innovation \u201cis the process of developing and deploying effective solutions to challenging and often systemic social and environmental issues in support of social progress.\u201d Social innovation focuses on the ideas and solutions that create social value, which can come from the nonprofit, private and public sectors. Modern social problems are enormously complex and this course will emphasize the interaction between different social science disciplines in the formulation of feasible and practical human-centric solutions that create social value.The course is modeled on the MIT Sloan Design Thinking program, which consists of 9 modules (see list of topics below). In this course, through interactive experiential learning, students will learn the key concepts and methods in design thinking and apply them to solve a current real life social problem. The ideas and insights gained in this course will be further applied in the other CU-FLASH minor courses.Group work is thoroughly emphasized and interaction of students from different majors is strongly encouraged. Students will work in groups and each group will be required to i) participate in group learning activities in classes, ii) perform exercises, and iii) do a final project on social innovation. A series of social innovation case studies and guest lectures from social innovators will be presented to students, reinforcing the practical aspects of this course. Students are strongly encouraged to interact with these practitioners.", "outcome": "  Students will understand what innovation is and how it creates social values.

What makes a winning innovation team?Modern organizational environments require creative solutions and the setting up of interdisciplinary innovation teams have become increasingly common. While the concepts and importance of interdisciplinary teamwork are well embraced, the additional practical considerations needed to foster a successful innovation team are relatively new and less well understood. This course focuses on two important aspects needed for an innovation team \u2013 the nurturing of individual and team creativity and management of group dynamics in innovation team. This course will cover the following topics: The nature of creativity (Creativity is not a gift; it is an extraordinary outcome of ordinary processes); Lack of creativity is a mental habit (Can over-learning kill creativity? Does too much education kill creativity? Novel conceptual combination could be magical cure of our uncreative mental habit); Characteristics of a creative mind (openness to experience, counterfactual thinking, use of paradoxical frames, and having the growth mindset); How to reward creativity; How does collective genius emerge in an organization; How did genius get inspired; Team diversity and team creativity; Team leadership; Transactive memory and coordination; and Challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration. This course is highly interactive and emphasizes on active learning. Students should expect to share ideas and listen to viewpoints offered by peers. Besides theories, each class will feature examples of modern social and business group management problems in a variety of organization settings that require innovative ideas.
