Such an understanding, however, would render it lifeless and irrelevant to the everyday life of the believers. In fact, the lived experiences of the believers also contribute to the particularities of Buddhist traditions established worldwide. This course aims at exploring the traditional and contemporary ways by which Buddhist teachings are expressed and experienced in the lives of the believers, in groups and individually. There are three major components to this course. First, we shall discuss the body-mind relation, and the nurturing of mental and physical health with topics such as dietary practices, meditation, mindfulness, counselling, and Buddhist psychology. We shall also contemplate on the cultural manifestations of Buddhism in literature, popular culture, language, photography, film, folk custom, etc. Finally, we shall consider the light that Buddhism may shed on topics of contemporary life such as love, death, transgender issues.No prior knowledge of Buddhism is necessary. SDG-SE #3 Good Health and Well-being:This course aims at relating students\u2019 personal growth and everyday life to Buddhist teachings so as to help them cultivate a constructive outlook on self-identity, and understand the Buddhist ways in promoting healthy lives and well-being.", "outcome": " Knowledge outcomes  To become familiar with some of the basic concepts and themes of Buddhism;\u009e  To understand Buddhist attitude to and connections with modern society in various historical settings and contemporary contexts;  To engage in a critical analysis of how Buddhism has accommodated itself with the modernization movements, and been reinvented to make it meaningful and useful to people nowadays;  To examine in what ways Buddhism transforms traditional and modern society and culture, and vice versa.

The other one will focus on the distribution and consumption of mass media. The class will visit a public space where vigorous commercial activities constantly taking place - for example, the Times Square Open Piazza, to observe and investigate what sorts of mass media are presented, how they, together with people, buildings, etc., made of the space, and also how various people passed by engage in different form of mass mediation.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2150", "title": "Reconstruction of Hong Kong History and Social Development", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Shaw College", "requirements": "For Shaw College students only.

By utilizing the environmental justice framework, students will explore how social inequalities shape the processes and outcomes of sustainable development. Environmental justice highlights the need to address the intersection of social justice and environmental issues. A relevant example is that the main contributors to and bearers of the consequences of climate change are not equally distributed across societies. Some societal groups are more vulnerable to climate risks or less capable of mitigating them. For instance, the rising energy costs to offset rising temperatures impact individuals living in poverty differently compared to those in better living conditions. The focus of student service will be on raising the awareness towards making an impact in one of the four dimensions of environmental justice: identifying distributional issues related to environmental impact, recognizing the environmental needs and voices of communities, fostering community participation in sustainability-promoting activities, and developing community capabilities for environmental resilience and sustainable growth. Course lectures will explore SDG #2 Zero Hunger, #7 Affordable and Clean Energy, #12 Responsible Consumption and Production, #13 Climate Action, #14 Life Below Water, #15 Life on Land, #17 Partnerships for the Goals, and students will be guided to initiate service-learning projects that attempt to address related social-environmental issues, for example designing a way to address energy poverty, tailor-made community responses to food waste and food security, collecting essential information regarding procurement policies and raising public awareness of their global impact, recycling, exploring potential impact of solid waste charging, the plastic-free movement, addition/extraction in country parks, environmental education, and other related topics approved by the course instructor.

The home we live in, the car or train we ride on, or the food we eat, all these pass through various economic cycles to reach us in their present form. Yet in the aftermath of financial crises there is a big misunderstanding among the masses as to what finance and investments is. There are so many cases about fallen integrity involving financial institutions and finance practitioners that generally people have started associating finance and investments with tricks and fraudulent practices. Understanding finance and investment thus becomes essential so we can go beyond such narrow narratives and understand finance better to live our lives productively and fully, irrespective of what job we chose for ourselves as we grow.This course enlightens students about investments, various institutions of modern financial world, important financial instruments and ethical standards expected of us while operating in this world and about money itself and this trains them up whether they chose a salaried job or become an entrepreneur.
