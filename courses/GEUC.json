In addition to covering fundamental concepts and methods related to social issues and policy analysis, the primary goal of the course is to develop students' knowledge, attitudes, and abilities to participate in public affairs. Therefore, the course will focus on social issues, using controversial topics throughout the curriculum to stimulate students' interest and discussion regarding public affairs. Besides classroom learning, the course will arrange for students to participate in service activities with government agencies, public institutions, and non-governmental organisations, allowing them to experience the operations of government and non-profit organisations and have opportunities to learn and grow from these experiences. These experience will also help students to understand the SDG #11 to make the cities and human settlement inclusive, safe , resilient and sustainable.", "outcome": " This course will furnish students with the following capacities and skills: \u00a0 1.Throughout the course, students are expected to master the basic concepts in policy analysis and be able to apply them to analyse real-world problems. More specifically, the students are expected to develop some basic knowledge of different features of civil society, social movement and governance. \u00a0 2. By taking this course, the students are expected to be familiar with a wide range of practical problems besting the ordinary citizens in Hong Kong and the Mainland China. The students are encouraged to consider and observe the ways in which civil society can help to tackle and resolve these problems, and whether too much hope is placed on civil society. \u00a0 3.This course is intended to develop the students into active and considerate citizens. In order to become good citizens, they must master generic skills in terms of articulating and communicating complicated ideas and analytical results effectively in both verbal and written formats. These skills are unlikely to emerge automatically. They have to be deliberately nurtured. In this course, through face-to-face interaction with social participants, and presentations and discussion exercises, the students are offered a well-organised setting where their analytical and communicating skills can burgeon. \u00a0  Students will achieve the following desirable learning outcomes of the College General Education Programme:  1. Describe connections and integrate knowledge across fields  2. Understand the meaning of service-learning and reflect on the experience learnt through different types of community service  3. Foster comprehensive awareness in the sustainable development goals  4. Develop leadership skills, and be able to collaborate and communicate effectively in teamwork  5.
