The growing interest in empathy, wellness and resilience has fuelled the design and implementation of structured educational programmes worldwide to cultivate empathy, especially when there is a globally increasing trend in professional burnout among undergraduates and resident trainees. Empathy in the medical setting includes appreciating the patient's emotions and the expression of that awareness. Empathy is an essential learning objective that can be cultivated. Empathy brings about patient satisfaction, promotes adherence to medical recommendations and good clinical outcomes, and more importantly, professional satisfaction. A key component of empathy is reflective capacity. Fostering reflective capacity within medical education helps develop critical thinking skills, inform clinical reasoning, and enhance professionalism among trainees. The development of reflective capacity is conducive to effective feedback in medical education and is an essential aspect of self-regulated and lifelong learning. Failure to reflect on one's thinking processes, including a critical examination of one's assumptions, beliefs, and conclusions, was recently described as a cognitive component of \"physician overconfidence,\" a contributing cause of diagnostic error in medicine. Reflection is not necessarily intuitive, especially in students at the initial stages of their medical careers. The over-arching aim of the course is to nurture and consolidate the key soft skills of an effective doctor and a healthy resilient personality through the development of reflective capacity and empathy.The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks, as outlined below, will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from years 2 to 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)The four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.Attendance to the empathic engagement workshop is mandatory.", "outcome": "After completing the course, students should be able to:1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0describe the key elements of an effective and empathic engagement with patients (affective, cognitive, somatic);2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0appreciate aspects of distressed or distancing empathy leading to over-arousal (sympathetic distress) or aversion;3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0appraise contexts and factors leading to empathic failure, distressed or distancing empathy;4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0understand the neural network of empathy\u00a0and how empathy (towards self and others, in personal and professional contexts)\u00a0translates into sustainable professional practice and life satisfaction;5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0understand the importance of cultivating reflective practice to maintain effective empathy in professional context; and6.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0understand and practice the process of reflective practice: reflection on content and process (context, self), reflection in action (real-time awareness), reflection\u00a0on action (retrospective).", "syllabus": "The course comprises three parts that utilize multimodal and multimedia means, which all aim to engage students' active participation and self-reflection.Topics: Empathy in clinical practiceLearning Contents: What is empathy?

The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks as outlined below will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from years 2 to 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3) 3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)The four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.After completing the course MEDU3160 in Year 3, students are expected to build the reflective capacity on mapping their external and internal resources and develop sensitivity to connect with society as knowledgeable, caring, and professional physicians. Medical students are also expected to explore self and teamwork in a clinical environment with a good sense of professionalism. A clinical medical setting is a teamwork environment with multidisciplinary professionals, e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, who must work together, communicate frequently, and have a common goal to care for the patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends medical students learn the principles of teamwork in their training. Moreover, nowadays, the work duty of a doctor is heavily loaded, physically and emotionally. The development of regular self-reflection in practice would help the students enhance resilience in managing stress. In this course, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) will be used to help the students reflect on how their values, needs, and personality traits greatly influence the helping process and style. Apart from MBTI, Mindfulness is recognized by the leading Medical Schools worldwide as a beneficial practice for their students and residents. Mindfulness is cultivated to promote self-care, self-awareness, and empathy with the ultimate aim of mutually improving the well\u2013being of doctors-in-training and for the long-term patient care with good quality. The course covers three different themes for students to explore and reflect on. It includes:a. being an effective team player; b. understanding personality type and professional Care Style through Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); andc. Mindfulness and Cognitive techniques for medical students.", "outcome": "After completing the course, students can:\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 have higher self-awareness and understanding of their Care Style, based on their 16 MBTI personality type preferences\u00a0\u2022 have specific recommendations on how they can flex their particular Care Style to increase patient's\u00a0satisfaction\u00a0\u2022 reflect on how their personality type preferences affect the teamwork, communication and potential source of stress in a clinical setting \u00a0\u2022 involve in the discussions relating to the professional issues, practical situations, and attitudes necessary for the professionals\u00a0\u2022 reflect their clinical experiences through peer review, constructive feedback, and consultation by the medical professional\u00a0\u2022 acquire and apply basic mindfulness and cognitive techniques", "syllabus": "The course is divided into two\u00a0parts which aim to engage students'\u00a0active participation and self-reflection. \u00a0\u00a0Part 1: Mindfulness and Cognitive techniques for medical students\u00a0\u00a0Part 2: Understanding personality type and professional Care Style through MBTI \u00a0- Introduction of MBTI\u00a0- Online questionnaire assessment \u00a0- Interpretation of MBTI result, Care Style and recommendations to self-development\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "N/A", "recommended_readings": "Teamwork and Negotiation:\u00a0\u00a0World Health Organization.
