This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students\u2019 appreciation of the role of \u2018power\u2019, \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe the evolution of the global political order and identify how power relations is related to the peace and security of world politics;

In the second part, we cover substantive policy issues including international trade and monetary system, foreign investment and multi-national corporations, etc.. It focuses on how the world economy is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on the development of various international and regional institutions that govern the current economic order. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global economic governance, with a particular focus on the transforming role of national states and the endeavors of international development on poverty and inequality reduction. Relevant country experiences will be adopted to illustrate the dynamics of economic growth and stability. GLSD2501 intends to promote students\u2019 appreciation of the role of institutions and politics in the operation of global economic order.
