It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations.

In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered. Based on the lessons of the past, together with recent trends in global climate change and social development, the human carrying capacity in contemporary societies will be systematically examined.
