The course aims at exposing students to a broad perspective and discussion about the dynamic relationship between theology and feminism. In addition to introducing the experiences of contemporary women and feminist critiques on violence, family, sexuality, poverty, ecology and media, the students will be encouraged to reexamine the ways in which the Western Judeo-Christian religious tradition has profoundly influenced our understanding of God and gender and to study the feminist interpretations of God-talks, sin and redemption, spirituality, leadership and church.", "outcome": "1.

Analyze and criticize how theologies are formulated against the female gender in Christian history until today.

examines a range of approaches to such endeavours. Since the inception of motion picture in 1895, cinema and institutional religions (including Christianity) have always been interested in each other \u2013 numerous films have used religious themes and motifs as subject matters, while religious communities have been eager to harness the cinema by critiquing, censoring, or making use of films in their ministries. The study of film from serious academic theological perspectives, however, was scarce until the mid 1990s. In this course, we explore a number of approaches by which the theological study of film can take place. These include, for example, the study of explicit representation of religious materials, the 'uncovering' of implicit religious motifs, the use of film as resource for theological reflection and construction. In particular, we shall consider how cinematic representations of certain important theological motifs may enrich conventional religious understanding. Films to be viewed and discussed cover a broad range from European art-house classics, popular Hollywood productions, to contemporary East Asian and Chinese language films.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5240", "title": "Congregational Studies", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Theology", "requirements": "For students in Master of Divinity or MA Theological Studies", "description": "This course will familiarize students with the recent discourse of congregational studies flourished both in the US and the UK context.

They will learn to distinguish between joint Asian concerns and the concerns of particular contexts.\u00a0c) In the different historical developments of Christianity in Asia, the students will encounter different models of Christianity and Christian relations to their cultural environment. The students will equally discover different issues of contextualization.\u00a0d) The students will develop sensitivity regarding mission, ecumenism, and contextualization in the postcolonial Asian context and learn about different Christian responses to the multi-religious context of Asia. The focus on the diversity of Christian churches and faith expressions in Asia leads beyond the dualism of local church and church in the West and helps perceive Christianity in a multi-polar world.", "syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction to the course\u00a0Week 2: The spread of Christianity in the first 10 centuries\u00a0Week 3: Asian Christianity from 1000 to 1800\u00a0Week 4: The emergence of the Protestant mission movement\u00a0Week 5: Protestant Christianity across 19th century Asia\u00a0Week 6: Korean Christianity\u00a0Week 7: Christianity and Buddhism in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia\u00a0Week 8: Christianity in Thailand\u00a0Week 9: Christianity in Myanmar\u00a0Week 10: Christianity facing Islam \u00a0Week 11: Christianity in India and Nepal\u00a0Week 12: Global faith movements in the Asian context\u00a0Week 13: Conclusions", "required_readings": "\u2022 Bevans, Stephen B. and Roger P.

It also articulates how theologies are spatially and temporally shaped. Accordingly, the relationship between theology and context will not be conceived as a kind of linear application of some ready-made theologies to the contemporary contexts, but a kind of interpretive effort which tries to correlate the Christian traditions with the contemporary cultural, socio-political and economical context. It will also discuss the practical dimension of the \u2018doing\u2019 of theologies. It is according to all this that some examples of contextual theology will be introduced.", "outcome": "Knowledge: Students acquire the following and/or critically reflect on them--\u00a01. The contextuality and situatedness of theological knowledge;\u00a02. The history of contextual theology;\u00a03. Deep understanding of at least four types of contextual theology;\u00a04. Methods and Methodologies of doing practical theology;\u00a05. Read at least one classic text in the field of contextual theology.\u00a0Attitude: students be able to fully appreciate that \u00a01. The value of a living faith lies in its openness and contextual relevance;\u00a02.

Introduction: \u00a0a. David Tracy's \"theology as public discourse for public realm\" as the theological orientation of Christian faith and praxis.\u00a0b.

Political theology and liberation theology as critical-prophetic witness of the church.\u00a0c. Emancipation and liberation as core themes for theologizing. \u00a0d. Local examples.\u00a0\u00a0Core Section 2: Interdisciplinary Dialogical Platform to experiment on the ways for theology to engage concrete public issues. Around five public/current issues from the below area-list will be selected each year for the dialogue. Experts or/and experienced practitioners in different fields of practice will be invited to the platform to share with students their analyses of the respective public/current issues, while theological responses (philosophical, exegetical, historical, and practical) will be given by teachers from different sub-disciplines in theology. Students are expected to engage in the dialogue with the theories and concepts they learnt from core section 1, and with their own experience as a citizen. They will also be required to continue the discussion on the eLearning platform (Blackboard) which constitutes one of their homework assignments.\u00a0\u00a01. Land Use in Hong Kong; and, Land in the Hebrew Bible: The dialogue will focus on issues related to sustainability, conservation, development, environmental justice, and theologies of territory in the Hebrew Bible.\u00a0\u00a02. Poverty and Justice in Hong Kong; and, Church and the Struggle for Social Justice: The dialogue will focus on (a) the different ways (social scientific and theological) of describing, categorizing, explaining, and interpreting the phenomenon of poverty in Hong Kong; (b) how can the church build a movement of Christians committed to tackling poverty in Hong Kong?\u00a0\u00a03.

Mainland-Hong Kong Relations; and Church-State Relations: The changing Mainland-HK relations amid integration and confrontation will be discussed. Beijing\u2019s policy toward HK and the local reactions in the midst of socio-economic integration in the recent decade will be the focus. This changing phenomenon will be critically engaged with various theological perspectives of church-state relations.\u00a0\u00a05. Rule of Law in Hong Kong; and Rule of Law and Christian Traditions: \u201cIs Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law under threat?\u201d \u201cHow is the rule of law to be understood, and understood in the local context?\u201d \u201cHow shall we understand the biblical foundations for the rule of law in the Western world?\u201d \u201cHow shall Christian communities respond to the concerned local debates?\u201d These questions will form the focal concern of the dialogue.\u00a0\u00a06. Selected issues in Social Policy; and Christian Vision of a Good Society: one concrete issue regarding local social policy on housing, labor, social welfare, medical and health care, education, or social security, etc. will be selected for the dialogue.
