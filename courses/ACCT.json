We must not only understand the meaning of accounting concepts within the framework of the standards, but also have a deep understanding of the impact of internal corporate governance arrangements and the external institutional environment on accounting information. In the teaching process, we will not ignore the fraud in the company's financial reporting practice, and summarize the frequently used financial fraud sections of financial reporting entities to improve the effectiveness of financial analysis. The course will also combine financial analysis with alternative data analysis, and introduce the application of emerging technologies in the field of financial analysis, to help students re-examine financial analysis with a broader perspective.\u672c\u79d1\u76ee\u5c07\u5168\u2faf\u7684\u8b1b\u8ff0\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u544a\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8ad6\u9ad4\u7cfb\u3002\u79d1\u76ee\u5167\u5bb9\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u2f63\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6703\u8a08\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u69cb\u5efa\u2f8f\u4e4b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8ad6\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e0d\u50c5\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u6e96\u5247\u6846\u67b6\u5167\u6703\u8a08\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\uff0c \u2f7d\u4e14\uff0c\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5167\u90e8\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u5b89\u6392\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u5236\u5ea6\u74b0\u5883\u5c0d\u6703\u8a08\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6559\u5b78\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6703\u5ffd\u7565\u516c\u53f8\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u544a\u5be6\u8e10\u4e2d\u7684\u821e\u5f0a\u2f8f\u70ba\uff0c\u7e3d\u7d50\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u544a\u5be6\u9ad4\u5e38\u2f64\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u821e\u5f0a\u2f3f\u6bb5\uff0c \u4ee5\u63d0\u2fbc\u8ca1\u52d9\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u79d1\u76ee\u4e5f\u6703\u628a\u8ca1\u52d9\u5206\u6790\u8207\u53e6\u985e\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7d50\u5408\uff0c \u4e26\u4ecb\u7d39\u65b0\u8208\u6280\u8853\u5728\u8ca1\u52d9\u5206\u6790\u9818\u57df\u7684\u61c9\u2f64\uff0c \u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u2f63\u2f64\u2f00\u500b\u66f4\u5ee3\u7684\u8996\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5be9\u8996\u8ca1\u52d9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "required_readings": "To be assigned by course teacher", "recommended_readings": "To be assigned by course teacher", "terms": {"2024-25 Term 1": {"SA-LEC (1840)": {"startTimes": ["8:30", "8:30", "8:30", "8:30"], "endTimes": ["18:15", "18:15", "18:15", "18:15"], "days": [0, 6, 5, 4], "locations": ["TBA", "Cheng Yu Tung Building LT4", "Cheng Yu Tung Building LT4", "Cheng Yu Tung Building LT4"], "instructors": ["Professor GU Zhaoyang", "Professor GU Zhaoyang", "Professor GU Zhaoyang", "Professor GU Zhaoyang"], "meetingDates": ["19/9", "20/9", "21/9", "22/9"]}, "SB-LEC (1041)": {"startTimes": ["8:30", "8:30"], "endTimes": ["18:15", "18:15"], "days": [0, 6], "locations": ["TBA", "Cheng Yu Tung Building LT5"], "instructors": ["Professor GU Zhaoyang", "Professor GU Zhaoyang"], "meetingDates": ["19/10", "20/10", "2/11", "3/11"]}}}, "assessments": {"Examination": "40", "Presentation": "10", "Participation": "30", "Report": "20"}}, {"code": "5620", "title": "Contemporary Management Accounting", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Business Administration", "requirements": "For students in Executive Master of Professional Accountancy;Pre-requisite: ACCT5111", "description": "This course examines the use of contemporary accounting systems for cost measurement, control, performance evaluation, and as a source of sustainable competitive advantage.

The goal is to provide students with a theoretical framework and practical guidance for fundamental quantitative investment, contributing to the cultivation of investment talent in the Chinese capital market.Specifically, this course will be divided into three parts. The first part introduces the basic methods and logic of financial analysis. Grounded in fundamental principles, quantitative investment models differ from models based on statistical arbitrage or high-frequency trading, with a crucial emphasis on understanding fundamentals. The second part introduces the main alpha factors: value factor, quality factor, and momentum factor etc. The value factor exploits investors' cognitive biases to identify undervalued stocks, the quality factor evaluates company performance to find stocks expected to generate value appreciation, while the momentum factor identifies stocks with continued price increases due to insufficient investor reactions to information. Both the value and quality factors require a rigorous foundation in fundamental analysis, reflecting the modern concept of value investing (value + quality), while the momentum factor serves as an effective measure of investor sentiment. The third part introduces the basic methods of fundamental quantification, including factor evaluation in multi-factor models, backtesting, weight allocation, risk control, and dynamic adjustments\u2014these are at the forefront of both theoretical and practical aspects.
