This lecture will introduce the concept of emotion as well as its relevant concepts feeling and affect, and their relevance in the socio-political context of contemporary China. It will explore how emotions are both a result of and a response to China's rapid transformations over the decades. Week 2: Emotions in Transition: A Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective on Emotional Experiences in China  This lecture will examine the historical evolution of various emotions in China and explore how the same emotions may be understood and experienced both similarly and differently across other societies. \u00a0Week 3: Caregiving and the Politics of Paternalistic Emotions  This lecture will explore the emotional labor of caregiving in China, particularly how family caregivers navigate affective expectations and the paternalistic nature of state-society relations.\u00a0 Week 4: \u201cWhy Family Hurts?\u201d: The Moral Dimensions of Emotions at Home  This lecture will explore the emotional complexities within Chinese family life, focusing on how familial relationships can become sources of both emotional support and emotional pain. It will highlight the tension between personal emotional needs and the moral imperatives of familial duty, exploring why emotions in the family context can be particularly fraught. Week 5: Bitterness and Endurance: Narrating Pain from Lives on the Margins  This lecture will explore the emotional experiences of rural migrants in urban China, focusing on the emotions of bitterness and endurance. It will examine how migrants navigate the emotional burdens of displacement, economic marginalization, and social exclusion, often unable to fully articulate their emotional suffering.\u00a0 Week 6: Class, Modernity, and Emotional Reflexivity  This lecture will examine how emotions like shame and pride intersect with social class in contemporary China. It will explore the role of personal growth groups (e.g., self-help, therapy) in constructing new emotional norms for different social classes. Week 7: Self-Development and the Emotional Economy of Purpose  This lecture will delve into the fluctuating emotions encountered in paths of self-development in China, focusing on the search for purpose and how feelings of deflation or emotional burnout are managed. Week 8: Performing Social Expectations and the \u201cGood Life\u201d  This lecture will examine how happiness in contemporary China is often intertwined with the performance of social expectations using examples such as food and weddings. Both food and weddings illustrate how happiness in China is deeply connected to societal expectations, where individuals navigate the emotional pressures of aligning personal fulfillment with collective standards of success and well-being. \u00a0Week 9: Well-being in China's Mental Health Boom  This lecture will explore the rise of mental health services in China, known as the \"psy-boom,\" and how it reflects the growing societal focus on emotional well-being. It will examine the pathologization of emotions such as anxiety and depression, and how mental health interventions are reshaping perceptions of well-being in contemporary China.\u00a0 Week 10: Understanding Depression in China: Cultural Contexts the Ethnography of Emotional Stress  This lecture will explore the complexities of understanding depression in China. It will focus on how depressive experiences in China are shaped by cultural, social, and historical factors. Students will critically engage with how these depressive experiences differ from Western biomedical models of mental health and why these cultural differences matter for diagnosis, treatment, and public health policies.\u00a0 Week 11: Digital Emotions: Social Media, Online Communities, and Emotional Expression in China  This lecture will explore how digital platforms shape emotional expression and community-building in contemporary China. We will examine how social media provides outlets for emotions often suppressed offline and fosters online communities around shared experiences, such as mental health. The lecture will also address the emotional impact of digital surveillance and censorship, highlighting the evolving relationship between technology, emotion, and social control. Week 12: Indifference, Silence, the Politics of Voice in China  Drawing on examples from everyday life, as well as state-citizen relations, the lecture will explore how emotions such as indifference and strategies of silence are used as coping mechanisms or forms of soft resistance. Week 13: Course Wrap-up: Reflecting on Emotional Landscapes in China and Personal Reflections  This final lecture will revisit the diverse emotional landscapes explored throughout the course\u2014ranging from family dynamics and social expectations to mental health and political silence\u2014and discuss how these affect both individual well-being and collective identity. This last section will also encourage students to engage in personal reflexivity, considering how their own cultural backgrounds and emotional frameworks influence their understanding of the material.\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " 1.

For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts\u2014thought, literature, ritual\u2014will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems. This semester will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-221 BCE) and the Six Dynasties (220-589 CE). The first laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the second saw the Buddhist \"conquest\" of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "6002", "title": "Critical Cultural History of China: Modern China", "career": "Postgraduate - Research", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of China Studies", "requirements": "For students under Division of China Studies", "description": "This course will focus on the emergence of two modern Chinas, that of the gentry and that of the people: 1) the re-emergence of Confucianism as \"this culture of ours\", eventually leading to the creation of lineage China in the 16th century; 2) the emergence of \"popular culture\", which includes a popular, increasingly state-supported pantheon of local gods, local festivals built around these gods, and popular literature (from the bianwen of the Tang to the xiaoshuo of the Ming).
