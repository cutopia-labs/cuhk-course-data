After offering an overview of modern China's quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China's experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe.", "outcome": "By the end of the semester, students should:\u00a0- be familiar with the key issues of urbanization in the Chinese context.\u00a0- be familiar with key concepts and social theories of current research in urban studies.\u00a0- be able to read and understand interdisciplinary academic publications on urban China.\u00a0- develop both oral and written skills to present coherent and succinct analysis.", "syllabus": "Week 1 Introduction:Urbanization and the Chinese ExperienceWeek 2 Understandingthe UrbanWeek 3 Urban Development in Late-Imperial ChinaWeek 4 Modernity and Urban TransformationWeek 5 Urban Development and Land PoliticsWeek 6 Urban Planning and Infrastructure BuildingWeek 7 Urban GovernanceWeek 8 Urbanizationunder Global CapitalismWeek 9 Citizenship and Right to CityWeek 10 Urban Space and Sociality\u00a0Week 11 Fieldtrip & Individual Consultation\u00a0Week 12 Sex, Gender and the City\u00a0Week 13 Case Study Presentation & Course Wrap-up\u00a0", "required_readings": "Engles, Friedrich. 2011. \u201cThe great towns.\u201d [Originally published in The Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844].
