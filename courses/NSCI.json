For so long we have been trying to learn \u2018about\u2019 nature. In fact there are so much we can learn \u2018from\u2019 it as if nature is our mentor. Biomimicry is about learning from Nature and emulate their designs to innovate sustainable solutions. For example, the hooks found on burs has inspired the invention of Velcro\u00ae, a fabric hook and loop fastener.Biomimicry provides an excellent platform to engage students in collaborative problem-based and integrated learning to solve real-world problems. Students will learn to work together and develop their creative problem-solving skills through identifying meaningful questions, searching relevant and credible information, developing sustainable solutions, and evaluating and sharing their solutions. It provides a new perspective for students to view questions differently and appreciate and value the natural world that we all share and live in.", "outcome": "1.
