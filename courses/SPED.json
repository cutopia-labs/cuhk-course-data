In this course, current curriculum policies and guidelines addressed by the Education Bureau and curriculum models with particular reference to physical education are addressed. In addition, stages of planning, implementation and evaluation of curriculum planning are discussed. Students are guided to develop critical thinking and reflective and problem-solving skills through class discussions and group works, so that they are able to construct their ideas on PE curriculum design with the consideration of their personal teaching philosophy and the visions and missions of the entire education and physical education.Up-to-date issues and practices related to overseas and local PE curriculums nowadays will be discussed throughout the course to let students analyze the problems and generate possible solutions for tackling with the problems encountered in PE nowadays, for instance, limited PE time, lack of motivation and low physical activity levels in PE, students\u2019 physical abilities, health and mental issues, etc. Through the process of identifying the problems, suggesting solutions, developing action plans and evaluation, our students as the pre-service teachers would be more self-initiated to reflect their roles as a gatekeeper for developing effective PE curriculums for Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. In the 21st century, health issues are always the controversial topic all over the world. Therefore, we expect PE professionals could create a supportive and motivational learning environment in school physical education for nurturing our young generations their interests in physical activities and lifelong exercise habits in their lifetime.", "outcome": "Upon the completion of this course, students will be able to:\u00a0\u2022 intensify their understanding on current school PE curriculums.\u00a0\u2022 recognize the current curriculum guidelines and policies adopted by the Education Bureau. \u00a0\u2022 understand the rationales, contents and concepts of various kinds of PE curriculum models. \u00a0\u2022 consider the influential factors in different stages of curriculum planning.\u00a0\u2022 design plans for school physical education curriculum for different target populations.\u00a0\u2022 apply the knowledge, theory and skills to authentic PE situations for curriculum planning in their future career", "syllabus": "\u2022 Teaching Philosophy & Roles of PE Teachers\u00a0\u2022 Educational Trends & Roles and Changes of PE in Hong Kong & Aims/Goals of PE \u00a0\u2022 Hong Kong PE Curriculum Guides (Primary & Secondary) \u00a0\u2022 Curriculum Planning for PE - Scheme of Work, Unit Plan & Lesson Plan & Curriculum Models for PE\u00a0\u2022 Curriculum Implementations & PE Safety\u00a0\u2022 PE Assessments & Equipment and Facilities\u00a0\u2022 Micro-Modules: Videos \u2013 Interviews with PE Teachers", "required_readings": "Nil", "recommended_readings": "\u2022 Buck, M.M., Lund, J.L., Harrison, J.M., & Cook, C.B.
