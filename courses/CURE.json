The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age.

How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity\u2014including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism\u2014 shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance.

While there are many approaches to the understanding of the discipline of religion and literature, this course covers traditional Chinese literature in relation to Taoist thought, practice, institution, and symbolism. The focus is on the formation of literary genres as religious expression and transcendental imagination in the context, as much as possible, of the development of Taoist religion. This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism. In this way, we can approach the intersections of the aesthetic and the religious as the essential humanity through the reading and analysis of the Taoist dimensions of literature.", "outcome":

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

The course introduces the core principles of writing critique on literature, films, popular culture, and visual art. Students are invited to discuss the works both aesthetically and critically. Another section of the course focuses on the fundamental skills specific to the media forms of print, digital platforms, and social media. Foregrounded with a comprehensive understanding of media infrastructures, students will be able to develop skills in collecting information, generating ideas, organizing the structure of their writing, and effectively presenting their thoughts.The final section draws on Henry Jenkins\u2019s concept of \u201cconvergence.\u201d We will compare the conventions of traditional narratives with the world of transmedia storytelling, including but not limited to the \u2018converging\u2019 realms of YouTube, podcasts, and interactive content on social media.

While Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts permeate classical Chinese novels, a large number of modern Chinese novels are peppered with Christian elements. As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the themes, narratives, characterization and language of the novels. Texts selected for reading include classical and modern novels, such as Strange Tales of Liaozhai, The Story of the Stone and The Journey to the West.", "outcome":

Students are expected to understand public art commission and reception, to master basic principles of utilizing public art as an urban design strategy, and to apply varying approaches to facilitating community art development, for example, advancing community art education, utilizing the cultural planning approach to assess community based cultural resources and the place-event approach to creating a sense of community attachment.", "syllabus": "Part I. Understanding Public and Community Art\u00a01. General Introduction\u00a0This section begins with displaying a range of public and community art cases and presents an introduction to the course. Three issues are covered in this introductory lecture. First, this section provides the conceptual discussions of public space, public art, and their art forms to enable students to understand what public art space and public art is. Second, this section explores the role of artists in public art space and community development. Third, a historical picture of public art is unfolded, which traces its origin, displays its developing process, and takes a glimpse into its enshrined social values. \u00a0\u00a02. Understanding Public Art Spaces \u00a0How should we understand public art spaces and the public nature of public art? This section embeds these issues into the understanding of a city; it then conveys the ideas that public spaces are socially produced and that city forms are imbued with ideologies. Public art stems from an urban setting and then grows through the urban regeneration movement, which comprises several issues, such as urban image, urban form and urban planning as well as their connections with public art space as a form of representational space. Furthermore, this section explores the public nature of public art by examining the process, by which artists derive value from individual creativity in the studios and immense it into the public space. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the alternative history of public art (Lacy, 1995, 25\u201328).\u00a0\u00a03. Public Art: The Monument\u00a0The monument is an important theoretical perspective to conceptualize public art. This section explains what a \u201cmonument\u201d is and investigates its role\u2014whether statue, memorial, or public statue\u2014in upholding a value-laden system of Western society. Issues under examination range from the connection between monument and national identity, the power and representation of public arts, the transformative understanding of public art as a monument, and the contradictions of public art. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the public nature of public art.\u00a0\u00a04. Critical Issues of Public Art Spaces\u00a0Who comprise the \u201caudience\u201d of public arts? What does \u201cintention\u201d mean and what is the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of public art? This section further discusses the theories on critical issues related to public art. This section begins with the discussions of the relevant terms and proceeds to various critical thoughts that challenge the value of public art and question its public nature. Students are expected to be able to analyze public art spaces and public art critically.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop critical thinking about public art spaces and public art.\u00a0\u00a05. Public Arts and Community Cultural Development: Theoretical Underpinnings of Community Art\u00a0This section provides a synopsis of the histories and theoretical issues of community art. The origin of community art is traced to the discourse of William Morris\u2019s call for social reintegration of artists and a revival of art in the 19th century. Theoretical issues include the \u201cpopular front\u201d and class consciousness, civil rights and identity politics, as well as cultural democracy and exchange. In addition, this section discusses the definitions of community, the role of community art, and the core purposes of community development. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the question, \u201cWhat makes art valuable?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Part II. Public Art Management \u00a06. Commission and Reception of Public Art\u00a0Based on the public nature of art, this section analyzes the process of art making, which comprises the elements of audience, context, and meaning. The process includes the following: acquiring cultural approval, arriving in public sites and places, providing visiting experiences with the audience, and generating meanings. Cases of Seattle and New York are used for this study. With regard to art reception, it analyzes the issues of taste, the education of the audience, as well as the relationship of art to society and popular visual culture. In addition, this section also distinguishes performance culture from monumental public art.\u00a0Tutorial: Distinguish public art from community art.\u00a0\u00a07. Public Art and Urban Design\u00a0This section presents an urban design approach to commissioning and making public art. It outlines the principles for creating a city image, which consists of five elements, and discusses their connections to public art. Various forms of public art in association with the urban setting and the mechanism of public art utilization as an urban design strategy are also discussed. Students are guided toward understanding the role of public arts in urban design guidelines. Moreover, we also discussed a set of design principles on the relationship between public art and various urban forms and spatial components, aimed at integrating public art into the urban setting as context and reference is discussed.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct design software training. \u00a0Assignment: Find a sample of public art (i.e., sculpture) using design principles to assess its location, site, and designs as well as to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Write a paper based on the research and use the design software to illustrate the arguments. \u00a0\u00a08. Government Policies for Public and Community Art Development\u00a0The relation between power and public and community art is a critical issue in public and community art management. This section discusses the governmental structure that funds and commissions public art, the infrastructure that underpins public art, and the governmental policies that support community art. The selection of commissions and projects is discussed, along with the process of seeking public and professional responses. International and the local Hong Kong contexts are examined to explore how government policies affect public and community art. In the local context, the role of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in promoting public art in Hong Kong is adopted as a case study.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct an in-class test. \u00a0\u00a09. Public Art in Metropolitan Cities\u00a0This section analyzes the role of public art in metropolitan cities, especially in the spheres of public transport, public open spaces, and public health system. A number of cases are presented, including forms of public art in the New York Subway system, London Underground and Mass Transit Railway, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. The issue of commissioning public arts is revisited in the public art in metropolitan context. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss urban design and public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a0Part III. Community Art Management\u00a010. Developmental Needs of the Field\u00a0How can community art development be supported? What do communities need? This section specifies the scope of cultural policies and the policy climate that community artists and community cultural development require. Moreover, this section discusses the material support that community cultural organizations and artists need, including funding supports and internal infrastructure and exchange.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the cultural policies for public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. From Theory to Practice I: Process to Develop Community Arts\u00a0From theory to practice, this section offers students a general orientation, which serves as a road map to the community-based art process. Five conceptual territories to advance community-based art as well as requisite techniques to fulfill tasks are introduced in this section, which include the following: 1) contacting people in the community; 2) conducting research on the culture of the community and the people\u2019s perception of their community; 3) taking actions to make art projects; 4) gaining feedbacks from the community; and 5) incorporating these art forms into community art education programs to pass on skills and sustain the impact. The program also includes strategies for planning and organizing community outreach and engagement programs as well as ways to enhance public awareness.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the process of applying theories in the creation of community art in order to practice and initiate the group project with the community.\u00a0\u00a012. From Theory to Practice II: Key Issues in Community Art Development\u00a0Based on the holistic picture of the steps to develop community arts, this section focuses on certain key and challenging issues in the process, specifically those on research methods and art making. The section introduces qualitative and quantitative research methods for the project of community art development, and students are expected to learn how to identify survey areas, design survey questionnaires, run group discussions, and map cultural mind-sets and assets. Another key issue is how to make arts and work with artists. An artist will be invited to be the guest speaker to give the lesson.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop a group project with the community. \u00a0\u00a013. Review and discussions\u00a0Students will present their on-going group projects on community art development, and the professor then provides comments and feedbacks on their projects. Key points of this course will also be reviewed in this class.", "required_readings": "Goldbard, A., 2006, New Creative Community: The Art of Cultural Development, Oakland, CA: New Village Press. \u00a0Grogan, D., Mercer, C. and Engwicht, D., 1996, The Cultural Planning Handbook, St. Leonards, N.S.W.: Allen & Unwin,\u00a0Harris, S.

It includes a wide range of perspectives, from Eurocentric to post-colonial, with an increasing focus on living culture that intertwines global and local narratives. This field involves diverse interpretive lenses, public discourse, human rights issues, and a shift from mere observation to immersive experiences. The interpretations of cultural heritage are shaped by numerous stakeholders, including educators, public program participants, researchers, writers, designers, creatives, consultants, curators, scientists, and historians. In recent years, technological advancements have further enhanced the use of digital media and social networking in cultural heritage, fostering new connections between visitors and heritage. Consequently, the interpretation of cultural heritage remains dynamic and fluid, embracing a variety of approaches and philosophies.This course aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of cultural heritage interpretations and the theoretical frameworks that offer different lenses and approaches for thinking about cultural heritage. It covers various types of cultural heritage, the role of storytelling in heritage interpretation, heritage as public discourse, identity issues, visitor engagement and education, tourism, community involvement, and ethical issues. Additionally, this course will examine how technology plays a role in engaging audiences and facilitating interpretations. By offering students diverse concepts of cultural heritage interpretations, they will gain a comprehensive understanding of current interpretive approaches, emerging trends, and innovations in the interpretation of heritage.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3508", "title": "Museum Studies", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "Not for students who have taken CUMT3108 or ANTH4720 or HIST5514", "description": "Museums have multiple roles in a society.

The course concludes by exploring work about indigeneity, memory, and environmentalism. The course is designed for advanced undergraduates with familiarity in critical approaches to literature, cinema, art, and media. Classes will grapple with the following questions: What qualifies as theory? Is theory necessarily abstract? What is the relationship of theory to particularity and difference? How can theory be made more attune to its contexts of production, dissemination, and application? How can film and visual art offer sources for theorizing? How might theoretical frameworks respond more significantly to social, economic, and environmental conditions from the restructuring of the capitalist system, expansion of media networks, dissolution of national borders, and deterioration of the climate crisis?", "outcome": "The objectives are: \u00a0 To become acquainted with theoretical texts and frameworks in Cultural Studies by marginalized voices from different peripheral social and geographic contexts To apply theory to analyze the articulation of race, gender, memory, and nature in literature, cinema, art, and media To formulate, develop, write, and revise an original critical essay using global cultural theories\u00a0", "syllabus": "Week 1: How to Theorize Culture?Week 2: Postcolonialism Week 3: Modernity/ColonialityWeek 4: GenderWeek 5: RaceWeek 6: Migration and MobilityWeek 7: Media PhilosophyWeek 8: Memory and TraumaWeek 9: IndigeneityWeek 10: Ecology and the Non-Human", "required_readings": " Frantz Fanon, \u201cThe So-Called Dependency Complex of the Colonized,\u201d in Black Skin, White Masks (1952; New York: Penguin, 2019), pp. 64-8 Paul Gilroy, \u201c\u2018Jewels Brought from Bondage\u2019: Black Music and the Politics of Authenticity,\u201d in Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness (London: Verso, 1993), pp. 72-110\u00a0 Lawrence Grossberg, \u201cThe Heart of Cultural Studies,\u201d in Cultural Studies in the Future Tense (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2010), pp. 7-30 Judith Halberstam, \u201cLow Theory,\u201d in The Queer Art of Failure (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006), pp. 1-25 Laura Marks, \u201cThe Memory of Touch,\u201d in The Skin of the Film: Intercultural Cinema, Embodiment, and the Senses (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000), pp. 127-193 Boaventura de Sousa Santos, \u201cCreating a Distance in Relation\u00a0 to Western-centric Political Imagination\u00a0 and Critical Theory,\u201d Epistemologies of the South: Justice Against Epistemicide (New York: Routledge, 2014), pp. 19-46 Silvia Rivera Cuscaniqui, \u201cCh'ixinakax utxiwa: A Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of Decolonization,\u201d South Atlantic Quarterly 111, no. 1 (2012): 95-109 Teri J.

Successful culture managers work to maintain healthy balance between culture and its relevant fields of interests, which sometimes could turn harmful or beneficial to the growth and development of the corresponding cultural area. The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to explain different national and social concerns for preserving culture; to identify the legal and ethnic issues relevant to cultural productions; to identify marketing strategies in cultural promotion; to evaluate the measures for maximizing the input of art practitioners; and to describe the various successful cultural schemes implemented in overseas countries.", "syllabus": "Section I: Culture in Context \u00a0\u00a01. Culture & States\u00a0The growth of cultural industries is strongly related to political environment and state policy. This lecture discusses the tension and mutual expectations between cultural workers and politicians. It will use the experience of the European Union and the US as examples. \u00a0\u00a02. Culture & Laws\u00a0Over the last few decades, there were a number of remarkable disputes over international art transactions and copy rights. Given the growing size of the art market, knowledge about the previous cases is essential. This lecture takes the examples taken from the US for discussions. \u00a0\u00a03. Culture & UNESCO\u00a0UNESCO is arguably a rising new power in forming a standard for evaluating cultural heritage of different nations. This lecture discusses the roles of UNESCO and its work in different cultural disciplines. National disputes over ownership of World Heritage sites will be bought up. \u00a0\u00a04. Culture & Community\u00a0Nowadays many nations and countries perceive culture and heritage as means to empower developing communities. This lecture discusses the conservation of indigenous or minorities cultures, and its impacts on the majority population of the same community. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture & Marketing \u00a0Culture and business are often taken as two contrasting disciplines. One of the key issues in cultural management is to develop cultural audience with both education and economic concerns. Religious sectors are a growing body of cultural venues for tourism and heritage management. This lecture discusses the debated concerns about conducting marketing or business-driven strategies in cultural and religious areas. \u00a0\u00a0Section II: Case Studies\u00a06. Cultural Management in Taiwan\u00a0Taiwan provides an excellent example to demonstrate the top-down organization of heritage sites. This lecture reviews a series of campaigns launched in Taiwan during the past twenty years, and discusses the reasons that may have contributed to engage the mass of Taiwan into different aspects of cultural industries. \u00a0\u00a07. Cultural Management in China\u00a0China represents many upcoming opportunities in cultural management. This lecture reviews some recent moves: rapid establishment of museums, growing number of commercial galleries and auction houses, rise of new Confucian schools, introduction of university degrees in cultural management, etc. The lecture discusses the consuming force underneath the cultural growth in the Mainland. \u00a0\u00a08. Cultural Management in Singapore\u00a0During the last two decades, the government of Singapore invested heavily on constructing cultural venues for both national and economic purposes. This lecture gives an overview of their establishment and invites students to reflect on the opportunities found in other areas of Asia. \u00a0\u00a09. Cultural Management in South Korea\u00a0This lecture discusses the contemporary cultural policies undertaken in South Korea. During the last decade, South Korea featured an economic miracle in Asia by rejuvenating the distressed financial market with cultural developments, which included the film industry, heritage protection, publication, and cultural tourism. \u00a0\u00a010. Cultural Management in UK\u00a0The United Kingdom was one of the earliest countries that invested heavily on promotion of cultural and arts events. This lecture gives a short history of the early developments made in the UK after the Second World War, and discusses the recent campaigns undertaken to break the boundaries between high arts and popular culture. \u00a0\u00a011. Cultural Management in USA\u00a0The United States distinguishes herself from all other countries by boosting the absence of a ministry for arts and culture, yet artists and cultural workers receive due respects for their contributions. This lecture looks at the case of the US and examines her success in cultural management. \u00a0\u00a012. Group presentation\u00a0This lecture is taken as a mock symposium for students to present their group projects and make comments on those by their peers. The presentation will be evaluated against the clarity and thoughts over the approved topics. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion: What is the best for Hong Kong? \u00a0This last session will summarize the topics covered throughout the course. Hong Kong is facing the challenge that many aspects of cultural developments in relation to urban planning, legislation, economy, national identity, and education are all pending. This lecture is an open discussion for students to brainstorm the possible approaches that Hong Kong could take in years to come.", "required_readings": "Week 1\u00a0Rosenstein, Carole. \u2018 Cultural policy and the political nature of culture\u2019 in J.P.

Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects.

These applications address current societal concerns, needs, and the ever-changing culture both locally and globally. The relevance of cultural heritage is influenced by complex power structures, including its presentation and representation in contexts such as postcolonialism, racial dynamics, gender, intergenerational equity, disparities in access to technology, marginalization, and the tension between localism and globalization. Additionally, the modern application of cultural heritage is shaped by evolving economic structures and technological advancements. Heritage is increasingly utilized by creative industries, with its assets digitized, interpreted, and experienced through advanced technologies such as AI and VR. Ensuring the continued relevance of cultural heritage has become a critical issue.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of cultural heritage and its diverse modern applications, along with the critical concepts that shape our perception of its relevance today. It addresses issues concerning cultural heritage and its relationship with changing urban demographics, climate change, intergenerational equity, and the application of technologies for future alternatives. Additionally, the course explores cultural heritage as an economic generator, its role in performance, sports, and games, and its adoption in personalized tours and emerging cultural industries.

How are museum workers (non-curatorial) trained? 3. What are the essential facilities a museum is expected to have? Why? 4. What is the role of museum in the contemporary arts, which is the area of debate regarding its significance and curatorship? The course develops students\u2019 awareness towards global developments in world-class museums, so that they are equipped with skills and knowledge necessary for long-term competition in museums or other cultural institutions.", "outcome": "At the end of the course, students should be able to: \u00a01.

Training II: museum non-curatorial workers\u00a0Curators are usually not the first person a visitor sees or gets in touch with in the museum. There are receptionists, volunteers, security guards, caretakers, cafe waiters, etc. These people are parts of the museum. Together their bonding represents the brand of the museum.

We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair. In each given case, we will trace various ways in which the questions we addressed in the first half of the course continue to inhabit the narratives about how a supposedly \u201cauthentic\u201d Islam figures in Muslims\u2019 search for political and cultural legitimacy in modern times. Thus, the course does not aim so much to provide a survey of Muslims politics, but to develop a critical perspective on the key concepts and images that frame Muslims\u2019 and non-Muslims\u2019 discussions about the convergence between Islam and modern politics.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3376", "title": "Religious Fundamentalism and Asian Cultures", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course aims to introduce the effects of religious fundamentalism on the politics of representation among various Asian cultures.
